## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-03

### ✨ Added

**Session Persistence & Auto-Resume** (Phase 1 & 2):

- **Regression Prevention**:
  - MUST run all existing tests before starting new work
  - MUST stop if any tests fail
  - Fix regressions FIRST before proceeding
- **Engineer Constraints**:
  - "MUST run verification tests before starting new work"
  - "MUST NOT proceed if existing tests are failing"
