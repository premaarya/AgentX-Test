## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ APPROVED - Implementation meets all requirements and quality standards.

**What Was Done**:
- Added structured self-reflection sections to all 5 subagent files
- Product Manager: 3 reflection areas (completeness, quality, clarity)
- Architect: 4 reflection areas (+ security/performance)
- UX Designer: 4 reflection areas (+ accessibility)

### Implementation Review

#### Product Manager Self-Reflection
**Location**: [.github/agents/product-manager.agent.md](../.github/agents/product-manager.agent.md#L145-L169)

**Assessment**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- 3 focused areas: completeness, quality, clarity
- Questions directly address PM responsibilities
- Checks for YAGNI (scope creep prevention)
- Verifies acceptance criteria are testable
- Ensures dependencies and risks identified

**Example Check**:
```markdown
### Quality
- Is the PRD clear and concise (no ambiguity)?
- Are user stories appropriately sized (2-5 days)?
- Did I apply YAGNI (no gold-plating features)?
```

✅ **No issues found**

---

#### Architect Self-Reflection
**Location**: [.github/agents/architect.agent.md](../.github/agents/architect.agent.md#L177-L208)

**Assessment**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- 4 comprehensive areas including security/performance
- Technical depth appropriate for role
- Checks for over-engineering (YAGNI for architects)
- Validates auth/authz and bottleneck identification
- Ensures diagrams and migration safety

**Example Check**:
```markdown
### Security & Performance
- Auth/authz: Properly designed? (who can access what?)
- Bottlenecks: Did I identify performance concerns?
- Validation: Proper input validation everywhere?
```

✅ **No issues found**

---

#### UX Designer Self-Reflection
**Location**: [.github/agents/ux-designer.agent.md](../.github/agents/ux-designer.agent.md#L145-L178)

**Assessment**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- 4 areas with accessibility as dedicated focus
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance check
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader verification
- Mobile/tablet/desktop variant coverage
- Color contrast sufficiency check

**Example Check**:
```markdown
### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance?
- Keyboard navigation supported?
- Screen reader friendly?
- Color contrast sufficient?
```

✅ **No issues found**

---

#### Engineer Self-Reflection
**Location**: [.github/agents/engineer.agent.md](../.github/agents/engineer.agent.md#L180-L231)

**Assessment**: ✅ Excellent (Enhanced from existing)

**Strengths**:
- 5 comprehensive areas including anti-patterns
- TDD mindset check ("Did I write tests FIRST?")
- Root cause analysis validation (not just symptoms)
- Standards compliance verification
- Premature optimization prevention

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced existing self-reflection section
- Added anti-patterns checklist
- Strengthened testing questions
- Added architecture compliance checks

**Example Check**:
```markdown
### Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)
- YAGNI: Did I add features not in the spec?
- Premature optimization: Did I optimize before profiling?
- God objects: Are my classes doing too much?
```

✅ **No issues found**

---

#### Reviewer Self-Reflection
**Location**: [.github/agents/reviewer.agent.md](../.github/agents/reviewer.agent.md#L232-L264)

**Assessment**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- 4 areas focused on review quality
- Meta-check: "Did I actually read the code?"
- Fairness balance (not too lenient/harsh)
- Specificity requirement (file:line references)
- Correctness verification

**Critical Addition**:
```markdown
**If you're unsure, review the code again. Don't approve if you have doubts.**
```

✅ **No issues found**
