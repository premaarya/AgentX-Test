## 1. Overview

### Feature Summary

The Phase 3 MCP App Dashboard provides a **single-pane-of-glass** interface inside VS Code via the MCP Apps framework (`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`). Rendered in an iframe, it communicates with the AgentX MCP server via the `postMessage` bridge. The dashboard surfaces agent states, ready queue, outcome trends, session timelines, memory health, active workflows, and global knowledge -- all in a native VS Code panel that respects the user's theme.

### Design Goals

1. **At-a-glance awareness**: Developers see the full state of AgentX in under 5 seconds
2. **Zero context-switching**: The dashboard lives inside VS Code as a native panel
3. **Theme-native**: Uses MCP Apps host CSS variables so the dashboard looks correct in both dark and light themes
4. **Actionable**: Every panel supports interactions (expand, filter, repair, remove) -- not just passive display
5. **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support per WCAG 2.1 AA

### Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to first insight (agent status visible) | < 5 seconds |
| Dashboard initial render | < 2 seconds |
| Task completion rate (triage a queue item) | > 90% |
| WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | 100% (axe-core zero violations) |
| User satisfaction (dashboard usefulness) | >= 4.0/5.0 |
| Dashboard bundle size | < 500 KB |

## 2. User Research

### User Personas (from PRD)

**Primary Persona: Solo Developer (Alex)**
- **Goals**: Stay aware of agent work while writing code; quickly triage failures; know if memory needs maintenance
- **Pain Points**: Cannot tell which agent is blocked; outcome patterns repeat across issues; terminal output is ephemeral
- **Technical Skill**: Advanced
- **Device Preference**: Desktop (VS Code, 1080p+ display)
- **Context**: Often has 2-3 panels open; dashboard competes for horizontal space

**Secondary Persona: Team Lead (Morgan)**
- **Goals**: Track progress of multiple agents; understand recurring failure patterns; manage team queue
- **Pain Points**: Scattered information across terminals and files; no historical view of outcomes; cannot see what's blocking progress
- **Technical Skill**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Device Preference**: Desktop (VS Code, 1440p+ display, often with sidebar)

### User Needs

1. **At-a-glance status**: Quickly see which of the 12 agents are idle, working, blocked, or in error
2. **Queue triage**: View and prioritize unblocked work, expand items for detail, and act
3. **Outcome visibility**: See pass/fail/partial trends over time with filtering
4. **Health awareness**: Know if memory store needs maintenance without running manual commands
5. **Session context**: See recent session activity and durations for handoff context
6. **Workflow progress**: Track in-flight workflows showing current step and iteration
7. **Global knowledge**: Browse cross-project patterns, pitfalls, conventions, and insights

## 3. User Flows

### 3.1 Primary Flow: Open Dashboard and Monitor

**Trigger**: Developer runs `AgentX: Open Dashboard` command or clicks status bar item
**Goal**: Gain full awareness of AgentX state
**Preconditions**: AgentX v7.6.0 extension active, MCP server running

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["User runs 'AgentX: Open Dashboard'"] --> B["VS Code opens Webview panel"]
    B --> C["Dashboard fetches data via MCP bridge"]
    C --> D["Dashboard renders all 7 sections"]
    D --> E["Auto-refresh starts (every 30s)"]
    E --> F{User scans agent cards}
    F -->|All healthy| G["Glance at trends and health"]
    F -->|Agent blocked/error| H["Click blocked agent card"]
    H --> I["View details -> navigate to issue"]
```

### 3.2 Queue Triage Flow

**Trigger**: User sees items in ready queue
**Goal**: Review and prioritize work

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["User scrolls to Ready Queue"] --> B["Sees sorted table (P0 first)"]
    B --> C["Clicks row to expand detail"]
    C --> D["Reads description, dependencies"]
    D --> E{Action needed?}
    E -->|Yes| F["Click 'Assign to Agent' button"]
    E -->|No| G["Collapse row, continue scanning"]
    F --> H["MCP tool call triggers workflow"]
```

### 3.3 Health Check and Repair Flow

**Trigger**: User notices health panel showing warnings
**Goal**: Diagnose and repair memory issues

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Health panel shows YELLOW/RED status"] --> B["User reads warning message"]
    B --> C{Action?}
    C -->|Investigate| D["Click 'Scan Now' button"]
    C -->|Fix immediately| E["Click 'Repair' button"]
    D --> F["Scan results update panel"]
    E --> G["Repair runs -> status updates to GREEN"]
```

### 3.4 Global Knowledge Review Flow

**Trigger**: User wants to review cross-project knowledge
**Goal**: Browse, filter, and manage global knowledge entries

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["User scrolls to Global Knowledge panel"] --> B["Sees entries sorted by usage count"]
    B --> C["Applies category filter (pattern/pitfall/convention/insight)"]
    C --> D["Reviews entries with source project attribution"]
    D --> E{Outdated entry?}
    E -->|Yes| F["Clicks 'Remove' action"]
    E -->|No| G["Notes useful patterns"]
    F --> H["Entry removed from global store"]
```

### 3.5 Error Scenarios

| Scenario | User Sees | Recovery Path |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| MCP server offline | "Unable to connect" banner with retry button | Click retry; check extension status |
| Data fetch timeout | Stale data with "Last updated: Xm ago" warning | Manual refresh button |
| Empty ready queue | "No work pending" empty state with illustration | Normal -- nothing to triage |
| Health scan fails | Error toast with diagnostic message | Retry or check extension logs |

## 6. Design System

### 6.1 Theme Integration (MCP Apps Host Variables)

The dashboard uses **MCP Apps host CSS variables** exclusively for theming. This ensures automatic compatibility with every VS Code theme (dark, light, high contrast).

**Variable Mapping**:

```css
:root {
  /* Mapped from MCP Apps host -- DO NOT hardcode colors */
  --bg-primary: var(--host-bg, #1e1e1e);
  --bg-secondary: var(--host-bg-secondary, #252526);
  --text-primary: var(--host-fg, #cccccc);
  --text-secondary: var(--host-fg-secondary, #999999);
  --accent: var(--host-accent, #007acc);
  --border: var(--host-border, #3c3c3c);
  --success: var(--host-success, #4caf50);
  --warning: var(--host-warning, #ff9800);
  --error: var(--host-error, #f44336);
  --insight: var(--host-insight, #c586c0);
  --font-family: var(--host-font-family, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif);
  --font-size: var(--host-font-size, 13px);
}
```

**Fallback values** ensure the prototype renders correctly standalone without hosting.

### 6.2 Layout & Grid

- **Grid System**: CSS Grid, 2-column on desktop (2fr 1fr), 2-column equal on medium, 1-column on narrow
- **Gap**: 20px between panels
- **Panel padding**: 16px
- **Panel border-radius**: 6px
- **Panel border**: 1px solid `--border`

### 6.3 Typography

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height | Color |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Dashboard title (H1) | 1.4rem | 700 | 1.3 | `--text-primary` |
| Panel heading (H2) | 1.1rem | 600 | 1.3 | `--text-primary` |
| Body text | `--font-size` (13px) | 400 | 1.5 | `--text-primary` |
| Secondary text | 0.85rem | 400 | 1.4 | `--text-secondary` |
| Badge text | 0.75rem | 600 | 1.0 | Varies by type |
| Stat value (large) | 1.5rem | 700 | 1.2 | `--text-primary` |
| Stat label | 0.8rem | 400 | 1.3 | `--text-secondary` |

### 6.4 Spacing System

Based on 4px increments (VS Code native feel):

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `xs` | 4px | Badge padding, inline gaps |
| `sm` | 8px | Icon gaps, tight padding |
| `md` | 12px | Card padding, row spacing |
| `lg` | 16px | Panel padding, section gaps |
| `xl` | 20px | Grid gap |
| `xxl` | 24px | Header padding, major sections |

### 6.5 Elevation

| Level | Shadow | Usage |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 0 | None | Default panels |
| 1 | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` | Hovered cards |
| 2 | `0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)` | Dropdown menus |

### 6.6 Buttons

| Variant | Background | Text | Border | Usage |
|---------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Primary | `--accent` | white | none | Main actions (Repair, Assign) |
| Secondary | `--bg-secondary` | `--text-primary` | `--border` | Secondary actions (Scan, Filter) |
| Ghost | transparent | `--accent` | none | Inline links ([Remove]) |
| Danger | `--error` | white | none | Destructive actions |

## 7. Interactions & Animations

### 7.1 Transition Standards

| Element | Property | Duration | Easing | Trigger |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Button hover | background-color | 0.2s | ease | Mouse hover |
| Card hover | box-shadow | 0.2s | ease | Mouse hover |
| Row expand | max-height, opacity | 0.25s | ease-out | Click/Enter |
| Row collapse | max-height, opacity | 0.2s | ease-in | Click/Enter |
| Bar chart fill | width | 0.3s | ease | Data update |
| Status badge | background-color | 0.3s | ease | State change |
| Panel fade-in | opacity | 0.2s | ease-in | Initial load |

### 7.2 Micro-Interactions

- **Row click**: Expands detail panel with slide-down animation. Toggles `aria-expanded` attribute.
- **Filter change**: Immediate re-render, no animation (feels instant).
- **Refresh click**: Button shows spinning icon for 0.5s, then data updates.
- **Remove click**: Entry fades out (0.2s), row removed from DOM.
- **Scan/Repair click**: Button text changes to "Scanning..."/"Repairing...", spinner shows, buttons disabled.

### 7.3 Auto-Refresh

- **Interval**: 30 seconds (configurable via `agentx.dashboard.autoRefreshSeconds`)
- **Visual**: "Last updated: Xs ago" counter increments; flashes briefly on refresh
- **User override**: Manual Refresh button triggers immediate refresh and resets timer
- **Stale data**: If last refresh > 60s, show yellow warning badge on timestamp

### 7.4 Loading States

| Component | Loading State |
|-----------|--------------|
| Full dashboard | Skeleton panels (gray animated gradient placeholders for each section) |
| Ready queue | Skeleton rows (3 placeholder rows with pulse animation) |
| Outcome chart | Skeleton bars (gray bars at 33% width each) |
| Health panel | Spinner in status area, stats show "--" |

---

## 8. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### 8.1 Keyboard Navigation Map

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Tab | Global | Move focus to next interactive element |
| Shift+Tab | Global | Move focus to previous interactive element |
| Enter | Queue row | Toggle expand/collapse detail |
| Space | Queue row | Toggle expand/collapse detail |
| Enter | Button | Activate button |
| Escape | Expanded detail | Collapse detail, return focus to row |
| Arrow Down | Filter dropdown | Move to next option |
| Arrow Up | Filter dropdown | Move to previous option |

### 8.2 Focus Management

- **Focus indicators**: 2px solid `--accent` outline with 2px offset on all focusable elements
- **Focus order**: Header -> Agent Cards (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) -> Ready Queue -> Outcome Trends -> Memory Health -> Workflows -> Sessions -> Global Knowledge -> Footer
- **Skip link**: Hidden "Skip to main content" link before header (visible on focus)

### 8.3 ARIA Attributes

| Component | Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Dashboard main | `role="main"` | Landmark |
| Agent status section | `aria-label="Agent Status Overview"` | Section label |
| Ready queue section | `aria-label="Ready Queue"` | Section label |
| Queue row (interactive) | `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, `aria-expanded` | Expandable |
| Detail panel | `role="region"`, `aria-labelledby` | Detail content |
| Health status | `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"` | Dynamic update |
| Refresh button | `aria-label="Refresh dashboard data"` | Action label |
| Filter dropdown | `aria-label="Filter by category"` | Input label |
| Remove link | `aria-label="Remove entry: {title}"` | Destructive action |
| Priority badge | `aria-label="Priority {level}"` | Semantic label |
| Stats values | `aria-label="{label}: {value}"` | Screen reader context |

### 8.4 Color Contrast (Verified)

| Combination | Ratio | Result |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| `--host-fg` (#ccc) on `--host-bg` (#1e1e1e) | 11.3:1 | [PASS] AA |
| `--host-fg-secondary` (#999) on `--host-bg` (#1e1e1e) | 6.4:1 | [PASS] AA |
| White on `--host-accent` (#007acc) | 4.7:1 | [PASS] AA |
| White on `--host-error` (#f48771) | 3.1:1 | [PASS] AA Large Text |
| Dark (#1e1e1e) on `--host-warning` (#cca700) | 7.2:1 | [PASS] AA |

### 8.5 Screen Reader Support

- **Live regions**: Health status updates announced via `aria-live="polite"`
- **Landmark roles**: `navigation`, `main`, `region` for major sections
- **Heading hierarchy**: H1 (Dashboard), H2 (each section), no skipped levels
- **Data tables**: Proper `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th scope="col">` usage
- **No information conveyed by color alone**: All status badges include text labels

### 8.6 Motion Sensitivity

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: disable all transitions and animations
- Auto-refresh indicator uses text update, not animation

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## 9. Responsive Design

### VS Code Panel Breakpoints

The dashboard renders inside a VS Code Webview panel, not a full browser viewport. Panel widths vary based on VS Code layout:

| Breakpoint | Panel Width | Layout | Grid |
|------------|-------------|--------|------|
| Narrow | < 600px | Single column, stacked | 1fr |
| Medium | 600px - 999px | Two-column equal | 1fr 1fr |
| Wide | >= 1000px | Two-column weighted | 2fr 1fr |

### Narrow Layout (< 600px)

- Agent cards: 1 per row, scrollable
- Ready queue: Simplified columns (Pri, Title, Action chevron)
- Outcome chart: Full width, compact bars
- Health + Sessions + Workflows + Knowledge: Full width, stacked
- Font size unchanged (VS Code controls zoom)

### Medium Layout (600px - 999px)

- Agent cards: 2 per row
- All panels: Full width or 50/50 side-by-side where space allows
- Queue detail: Full width below table
- Tables: Horizontal scroll if needed

### Wide Layout (>= 1000px)

- Agent cards: 4 per row (3 rows for all 12)
- Left column (2/3): Queue, Trends, Workflows
- Right column (1/3): Health, Sessions
- Global Knowledge: Full width (spans both columns)

### Touch Targets

Although primarily desktop, VS Code can be used on touch devices:
- Minimum touch target: 44x44px for all interactive elements
- Adequate spacing between clickable rows

## 11. Implementation Notes

### 11.1 For Engineers

**Technology Stack**:
- **Framework**: React 19+ (from extension dependencies)
- **Build**: Vite with `vite-plugin-singlefile` for single-file HTML output
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties mapping to `--host-*` variables (no Tailwind, no CSS modules)
- **Data**: MCP App bridge (`useApp()` hook) for tool calls and resource reads
- **State**: React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`) + `useAutoRefresh` custom hook

**New Components to Create (per Spec Section 6.2)**:

| Component | File | Props Interface |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| `DashboardApp` | `dashboard/dashboardApp.tsx` | Root component |
| `AgentStatusCards` | `dashboard/components/AgentStatusCards.tsx` | `{ agents: AgentStateItem[] }` |
| `ReadyQueueTable` | `dashboard/components/ReadyQueueTable.tsx` | `{ items: ReadyQueueItem[], onSelect }` |
| `OutcomeTrendsChart` | `dashboard/components/OutcomeTrendsChart.tsx` | `{ data: OutcomeTrendPoint[], filters, onFilterChange }` |
| `SessionTimeline` | `dashboard/components/SessionTimeline.tsx` | `{ sessions: SessionIndex[] }` |
| `MemoryHealthPanel` | `dashboard/components/MemoryHealthPanel.tsx` | `{ report: HealthReport, onRepair, onScan }` |
| `WorkflowProgress` | `dashboard/components/WorkflowProgress.tsx` | `{ workflows: WorkflowStatus[] }` |
| `GlobalKnowledgePanel` | `dashboard/components/GlobalKnowledgePanel.tsx` | `{ entries: KnowledgeIndex[], stats, onRemove }` |

**CSS Approach**:
- Single `dashboard.css` file with CSS custom properties
- BEM-like naming: `.agent-card`, `.agent-card__header`, `.agent-card--working`
- All colors via variables (never hardcoded)
- Responsive via CSS Grid + media queries

**Important Constraints**:
- Bundle MUST be < 500 KB (no heavy chart libraries)
- Use pure CSS for the outcome chart (flexbox + percentage widths)
- All text content must use ASCII characters only
- ARIA attributes on every interactive element

### 11.2 Assets Needed

- [x] AgentX icon SVG (existing: `vscode-extension/resources/agentx-icon.svg`)
- [ ] No additional images needed (CSS-only design)
- [ ] No external fonts (use system font stack via `--host-font-family`)

### 11.3 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Render in VS Code Webview (dark theme)
- [ ] Render in VS Code Webview (light theme)
- [ ] Render in VS Code Webview (high contrast theme)
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation (Tab through all sections)
- [ ] Screen reader test (NVDA or JAWS)
- [ ] axe-core audit (zero violations)
- [ ] Responsive at 400px, 800px, 1200px panel widths
- [ ] Auto-refresh cycles without memory leaks
- [ ] Bundle size < 500 KB
- [ ] ASCII-only compliance (no emoji or Unicode symbols)

## 12. Open Questions

| # | Question | Owner | Status |
|---|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Should outcome trends use a time-series daily chart or aggregate summary bars? | Architect | Open -- prototype shows aggregate bars |
| 2 | Should the Global Knowledge filter support multi-select categories? | PM | Open -- recommend single-select first |
| 3 | Should clicking an agent card navigate to the issue or show an in-panel detail? | UX | Open -- recommend in-panel detail |
| 4 | Should the dashboard support VS Code panel drag-to-dock behavior? | Engineer | Open -- depends on MCP Apps hosting |
| 5 | Should session timeline entries be collapsible or always visible? | UX | Resolved -- collapsible (click to expand) |
