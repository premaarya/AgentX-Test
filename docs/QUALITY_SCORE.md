| Chat participant | B | Functional but context loading could be more selective |
| Harness state utilities | B | File-backed harness state and loop gating are active, but the richer evidence model remains partial |
| Test coverage | C | Tests exist, but chat flows, workflow commands, and harness integration paths still need broader regression coverage |

| Component | Grade | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Repo knowledge as system of record | A- | Strong AGENTS, WORKFLOW, skills, templates, and ADR/spec patterns in-repo |
| Execution plan discipline | B | Policy and template strengthened; mechanical enforcement still partial |
| Validation evidence model | C | Evidence-backed validation now documented; repo-wide evidence capture and gates not yet implemented |
| Runtime harness primitives | C | Loop state and command safety exist; explicit thread/turn/item/evidence model not yet implemented in visible runtime |
