## Grading Scale

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A | Production-ready, well-tested, well-documented, no known issues |
| B | Functional, minor gaps in tests or docs |
| C | Works but has notable gaps -- missing tests, stale docs, or partial features |
| D | Partially implemented or has known reliability issues |
| F | Placeholder or non-functional |
