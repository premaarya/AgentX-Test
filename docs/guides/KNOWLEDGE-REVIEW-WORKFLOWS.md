# Knowledge And Review Workflows

## Purpose

This guide defines the shared workflow contract for three related AgentX concerns:

- post-review knowledge capture
- agent-native review parity
- durable review findings and promotion

These concerns are intentionally documented together because they form one compound-engineering workflow: shape the work with prior learnings, evaluate parity, decide what should be preserved, and track durable follow-up work when review findings require it.

## Workflow Chain

1. Start with a brainstorm step when planning would benefit from prior learnings or known workflow constraints.
2. Finish implementation review and validation.
3. Run agent-native review to check action parity, context parity, and shared workspace expectations.
4. Resolve whether the outcome creates reusable knowledge that should be captured.
5. Persist durable review findings when follow-up work should survive beyond the current review cycle.
6. Promote important findings into the normal AgentX backlog instead of creating a parallel tracker.

## Agent-Native Review

### Review Lens

Agent-native review is architectural and workflow-focused. It does not score naming style, formatting taste, or subjective implementation preferences.

The review asks three questions:

1. Action parity: can agents reach the same high-value review-time actions that users can trigger?
2. Context parity: do agents and users operate on the same workspace, issue, plan, review, and state context?
3. Shared workspace expectations: do both paths resolve the same repo-local artifacts, guidance, and workflow contracts?

### Capability Map

| Capability | User Surface | Agent Surface | Shared Artifacts | Why It Matters |
|------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Brainstorm with learnings | Command palette, Work sidebar | `@agentx brainstorm ...` | this guide, `docs/artifacts/learnings/` | Planning should start from reusable lessons instead of a cold start when prior knowledge exists |
| Workflow execution | Command palette, Work sidebar | `@agentx run ...` | issue, plan, workflow state | Review findings are weak if agents cannot trigger the same delivery flow |
| Review learnings retrieval | Command palette, Work sidebar | `@agentx learnings review ...` | `docs/artifacts/learnings/` | Review should reuse prior solutions without user-only lookup steps |
| Compound loop visibility | Command palette, Work and Quality sidebars | `@agentx compound` | this guide, `docs/artifacts/learnings/`, `docs/artifacts/reviews/findings/` | Operators and agents should inspect the same post-review capture and follow-up state |
| Knowledge capture guidance | Command palette, Work sidebar | `@agentx capture guidance` | this guide, `docs/artifacts/learnings/` | Reusable outcomes should be preserved consistently after review |
| Learning capture scaffold | Command palette, Work and Quality sidebars | `@agentx create learning capture` | `docs/artifacts/learnings/`, harness state | Capture should start from the active issue context instead of a blank file |
| Durable review findings | Command palette, Quality sidebar | `@agentx review findings` | this guide, `docs/artifacts/reviews/findings/` | Important review outcomes should remain visible across sessions |

### Scoring Rubric

#### Action Parity

- 100%: every mapped capability is available in both user and agent surfaces
- 50-99%: at least one mapped capability is missing from one side
- 0-49%: review-time actions are materially user-only or agent-only

#### Context Parity

- 100%: workspace root, pending clarification state, execution plan access, and state-file access are shared
- 50-99%: one shared context dependency is missing or indirect
- 0-49%: user and agent flows rely on different context models

#### Shared Workspace Expectations

- 100%: review guidance, templates, and review surfaces all point at the same repo-local contract
- 50-99%: one contract artifact or review surface is missing
- 0-49%: review output depends on disconnected or host-specific assumptions

### Severity Model

- High: a user-visible review capability is not reachable for agents, or vice versa
- Medium: the capability exists, but shared context or contract artifacts are missing
- Low: the parity path exists but is weakly documented or exposed in only one minor surface
- None: no parity gap detected

### Output Expectations

Agent-native review output should include:

- a capability map
- per-pillar scores for action parity, context parity, and shared workspace expectations
- concrete findings that point to architectural gaps
- an advisory-first recommendation, not an immediate hard gate

## Knowledge Capture

### Planning Entry Point

Use the brainstorm step before planning when the repo likely already contains reusable guidance.

Operator surfaces:

- Command palette: `AgentX: Show Brainstorm Guide`
- Work sidebar: `Brainstorm`
- Chat: `@agentx brainstorm <topic>`

The brainstorm output should pull forward the highest-signal planning learnings, restate the active issue context when available, and make the next narrowing step explicit before execution begins.

### Trigger Model

- Mandatory capture:
  Work produces reusable workflow, architecture, review, validation, or operator guidance that is likely to help future planning or review.
- Optional capture:
  Work is useful but narrow, local, or low-leverage, so a capture artifact is helpful but not required.
- Skip capture:
  Work is trivial, transient, duplicated by an existing learning, or too weakly validated to preserve as durable guidance.

### Operator-Facing Path

1. Finish review and validate the final outcome.
2. Resolve the capture decision as mandatory, optional, or skip.
3. Inspect the compound loop view when you need the combined picture of reusable learnings, promotable review findings, and capture readiness.
4. When capture is produced, store it under `docs/artifacts/learnings/LEARNING-<issue>.md`.
5. Prefer scaffolding capture from the active issue context through `AgentX: Create Learning Capture` or `@agentx create learning capture`.
6. Link the learning back to the originating issue and its supporting ADR, spec, review, or validation artifacts.
7. If capture is skipped, record a short rationale in the close-out summary or issue comment.

### Autonomous Execution Path

1. AgentX finishes the same review and validation steps it would require from an operator.
2. AgentX resolves the capture decision after review, not during initial implementation.
3. AgentX can surface the compound loop or scaffold a learning artifact from the active harness thread before writing a final capture.
4. When capture is required or accepted, AgentX creates the learning artifact and mentions it in the final summary.
5. The flow stays advisory-first until stronger automation and duplication checks are proven.

### Artifact Location

- Curated durable learnings: `docs/artifacts/learnings/LEARNING-<issue>.md`
- Durable review findings: `docs/artifacts/reviews/findings/FINDING-<issue>-<id>.md`
- Source documents remain in their original families, such as `docs/artifacts/adr/`, `docs/artifacts/specs/`, `docs/artifacts/reviews/`, and issue state

### Minimum Link-Back Requirements

Each curated learning should link back to:

- the originating issue
- the main supporting design or execution artifacts
- the review or validation artifact that makes the learning trustworthy

## Durable Review Findings

### Durable Record

Store durable review findings under `docs/artifacts/reviews/findings/FINDING-<issue>-<id>.md`.

Each durable finding record should capture:

- source review artifact
- source issue when known
- severity
- workflow status using the standard AgentX status set
- priority using `p0` through `p3`
- owner or suggested owner
- dependencies
- evidence links
- promotion classification
- linked backlog issue once promoted

### Status Contract

Durable findings reuse the normal AgentX workflow states so review follow-up does not create a second state machine.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Backlog | Finding is captured and awaiting triage or promotion |
| Ready | Finding has been accepted as follow-up work and is ready to be picked up |
| In Progress | Follow-up implementation is underway |
| In Review | Follow-up change is under review |
| Done | Follow-up is resolved or explicitly closed |

### Promotion Contract

Each finding must declare one of these promotion modes:

- `review-only`: preserve the finding in the review record, but do not create a backlog item
- `recommended`: finding is important enough that maintainers should normally promote it
- `required`: finding should become tracked backlog work unless it is immediately resolved in the current review cycle

### Promote Versus Keep Review-Only

Promote the finding when one or more of these conditions are true:

- the finding affects correctness, security, resilience, or workflow safety
- the finding requires code or documentation work beyond the current review cycle
- the finding should be prioritized, assigned, or tracked across sessions
- the finding blocks parity, review quality, or repeatable operator behavior

Keep the finding review-only when one or more of these conditions are true:

- the note is informational and needs no tracked follow-up
- the issue is already fully covered by an existing backlog item
- the concern is too weakly evidenced to justify tracked work
- the fix is completed before the review closes

### Lifecycle Rules

1. Capture the durable finding record during review or immediately after review.
2. Use `Backlog` as the initial status for captured findings.
3. Promote only into the existing AgentX issue flow. Do not create a parallel tracker.
4. When promoted, link the created backlog issue number back into the finding record.
5. Let the promoted issue follow the normal AgentX workflow from `Backlog` to `Done`.
6. Keep dependencies and evidence links in the finding record even after promotion.

## Notes

- Local and GitHub-backed workflows should use the same artifact-based contract even when storage or status plumbing differs.
- Do not create a second backlog or sidecar tracker for learnings.
- Do not treat raw runtime observations as curated learnings by default.
- Prefer a small number of high-signal learning artifacts over a large volume of weak notes.
