**Summary:**
> Started the implementation loop, loaded the engineer contract plus the AI/test skills, confirmed that phase 1 is a contract-first rollout, and narrowed the scope to manifest, baseline, report validation, and runner-selection groundwork without Quality sidebar changes.

## Session 1 - Engineer (2026-03-20)

### What I Accomplished
- Started the implementation loop for issue #235
- Reviewed the ADR/spec and the current extension eval surface
- Chose the first source slice: repo-local contract loading and validation in `vscode-extension/src/eval/`
- Installed the YAML dependency needed for manifest parsing
- Implemented the AI evaluation contract facade, internals, and types in the extension
- Added targeted tests covering complete, missing-baseline, remote-runner, and facade summary cases

### Testing & Verification
- Dependency install completed successfully in `vscode-extension`
- `npm run compile` passed in `vscode-extension`
- `mocha "out/test/eval/aiEvaluationContract*.js"` passed after compile

### Issues & Blockers
- No technical blocker currently
- Existing unrelated workspace changes are present and will be left untouched

### Next Steps
- Wire the new contract state and normalized reports into downstream consumers in a later slice
- Keep Quality sidebar work deferred until explicitly scheduled

### Context for Next Agent
The user explicitly deferred Quality sidebar work. This slice intentionally stops at contract loading/validation and runner-selection groundwork, with no UI wiring.

## Session 2 - Engineer (2026-03-20)

### What I Accomplished
- Added a dedicated AI evaluation runner facade, internals, and types under `vscode-extension/src/eval/`
- Implemented execution planning that blocks incomplete contracts before adapter execution
- Added normalization from raw adapter output into the AgentX report shape
- Added persisted normalized report writing and raw-output retention controlled by manifest policy
- Added targeted runner tests for planning, normalization, persistence, and facade execution

### Testing & Verification
- `npm run compile` passed in `vscode-extension`
- `mocha "out/test/eval/aiEvaluationContract*.js" "out/test/eval/aiEvaluationRunner*.js"` passed

### Issues & Blockers
- No technical blocker currently
- Existing unrelated workspace changes are still present and left untouched

### Next Steps
- Wire normalized AI evaluation evidence into review and downstream consumer surfaces in a later slice
- Decide how promptfoo-compatible and Azure-compatible adapters should be surfaced operationally without changing the manifest contract
- Keep Quality sidebar work deferred until explicitly scheduled

### Context for Next Agent
Runner execution groundwork is now available through injected adapters and shell-backed adapter helpers. The remaining work is consumer integration and operational runner wiring, not contract or report-shape design.

## Session 3 - Engineer (2026-03-20)

### What I Accomplished
- Pivoted issue `#235` toward lightweight best-practice adoption after the user clarified they do not want promptfoo replication or deeper integration
- Added a durable guide at `docs/guides/AI-EVALUATION-LIGHTWEIGHT.md`
- Added a root-level `prompts/` starter with a versioned prompt file convention and one starter prompt
- Added a root-level `evaluation/` starter pack with a minimal manifest, baseline, dataset, and rubric files
- Updated execution docs to record the shift from adapter emphasis to lightweight prompt/eval practice

## Session 4 - Engineer (2026-03-20)

### What I Accomplished
- Added `scripts/run-ai-eval-sample.ps1` as a tiny local sample runner for the starter pack
- Wired `evaluation/agentx.eval.yaml` to execute that script through the existing shell-backed execution contract
- Updated the starter baseline to match the sample runner's current placeholder-detection behavior
- Documented that the starter runner is intentionally lightweight and should be replaced by project-specific evaluation logic

### Testing & Verification
- `./scripts/run-ai-eval-sample.ps1` emitted valid raw evaluation JSON
- The sample runner returned `0.5` for both starter metrics and reported the placeholder prompt plus all three starter dataset rows as failure slices

### Issues & Blockers
- The sample runner is a bootstrap path only; it is not a substitute for real task- or model-level evaluation

### Next Steps
- If the output is stable, use it as the first end-to-end smoke path for the extension command flow
- Replace starter placeholders with project-specific assets so the sample path can move from intentional failure to a real passing smoke test

## Session 5 - Engineer (2026-03-20)

### What I Accomplished
- Replaced the generic starter prompt with a concrete AgentX issue-classification prompt
- Replaced placeholder dataset rows with five real classification examples covering bug, docs, story, spike, and devops work
- Updated the sample runner to score exact label accuracy using a deterministic local heuristic baseline
- Updated the manifest, baseline, and docs so the starter pack now represents one real evaluation example instead of placeholder detection

### Testing & Verification
- `./scripts/run-ai-eval-sample.ps1` emitted valid raw evaluation JSON for the concrete issue-classification example
- The evaluator returned `1.0` for both metrics across five regression rows with no failure slices

### Issues & Blockers
- The current runner is still a deterministic baseline, not a model-backed classifier; it demonstrates the workflow shape rather than LLM quality

### Next Steps
- Use the concrete example as the first normalized-report smoke path for the extension command flow
- Replace the deterministic baseline when a project-specific model-backed evaluator is ready

### Testing & Verification
- Starter manifest and baseline shapes were checked against the existing extension contract tests and types
- No new runtime integration was added in this slice

### Issues & Blockers
- The starter dataset and prompt content are placeholders and must be replaced by project-specific content before any real evaluation gate is trusted

### Next Steps
- Replace starter rows and placeholder model identifiers with project-specific content for the first real AI feature
- Add review guidance or CI checks only after real datasets and rubrics exist
- Keep the contract lightweight and avoid copying external tool semantics

### Context for Next Agent
The repo now has a minimal, valid starter pack for `prompts/` and `evaluation/`. Future work should improve the quality of project-specific assets, not expand the config model to look more like promptfoo.

## Completion Summary

**Final Status**: Ready for Review
**Total Sessions**: 5
**Total Checkpoints**: 1
**Overall Coverage**: Targeted eval tests added; broader repo suite also passed during targeted run
**Ready for Handoff**: Yes

### Key Achievements
- Scoped the first implementation slice to contract validation and runner groundwork
- Anchored the work with a repo-local execution plan and progress log
- Added the extension module that reads `evaluation/agentx.eval.yaml`, `evaluation/baseline.json`, and normalized report artifacts
- Added a sibling runner module that plans execution, normalizes runner output, and persists AgentX report files
- Added a lightweight starter pack for prompt files, datasets, rubrics, and baselines that keeps the repo contract usable without copying promptfoo
- Added a runnable starter sample path that fails until placeholder prompt and dataset content are replaced
- Converted the starter into a concrete issue-classification evaluation example with a passing deterministic local baseline

### Outstanding Items
- Integrate review and Quality sidebar consumers in later slices
- Replace the deterministic baseline with a model-backed evaluator when a project-specific AI workflow is ready
