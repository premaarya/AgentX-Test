# Root Cause Analysis: Workflow Violation in Issue #88

**Date**: January 26, 2026  
**Incident**: Agent skipped AgentX multi-agent workflow (PM → Architect → UX → Engineer → Reviewer)  
**Impact**: Demo implementation completed without required documents (PRD, ADR, Spec, UX, Review)  
**Resolution**: Documents created retroactively, workflow corrected  
**Severity**: **High** (Framework integrity violation)

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Despite having explicit workflow instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and complete agent definitions with enforcement gates, the agent **bypassed the entire multi-agent workflow** and jumped directly to implementation. This represents a **critical failure in workflow enforcement** that undermines the core value proposition of AgentX.

**The Irony**: While building a framework to enforce structured workflows, the agent violated those very workflows.

**Key Finding**: Workflow is **documented** but not **enforced** by automation.

## ⏱️ Timeline of Incident

| Time | Event | What Should Have Happened |
|------|-------|---------------------------|
| **T0** | User: "Build Idea Management demo" | ❌ Agent jumped to coding |
| T0+0min | **Should have**: Read AGENTS.md | ✅ Understand workflow requirements |
| T0+5min | **Should have**: Create issue #88 with `type:epic` | ✅ Classify request properly |
| T0+10min | **Should have**: PM Agent creates PRD | ✅ docs/prd/PRD-88.md (400 lines) |
| T0+40min | **Should have**: Architect creates ADR + Spec | ✅ docs/adr/ + docs/specs/ (1,100 lines) |
| T0+70min | **Should have**: UX Designer creates UX Design | ✅ docs/ux/UX-88.md (420 lines) |
| T0+100min | **Should have**: Engineer implements code | ✅ 2,500+ lines code + tests |
| T0+180min | **Should have**: Reviewer conducts review | ✅ docs/reviews/REVIEW-88.md (780 lines) |
| **T0+360min** | **ACTUAL**: User notices violation | ⚠️ "Did you follow AgentX workflow?" |
| T0+420min | Agent creates ALL documents retroactively | 🔄 Corrective action (2,700+ lines) |
| T0+480min | Adds orchestration labels, closes issue | ✅ Workflow completed |

**Total Violation Duration**: ~6 hours of work without workflow compliance

## 🔍 Root Causes (5 Whys Analysis)

### Problem: Agent skipped multi-agent workflow

**Why 1: Why did the agent skip the workflow?**
→ Agent optimized for "fast delivery" instead of "correct process"

**Why 2: Why did agent optimize for speed over process?**
→ User request framed as "build demo" triggered implementation pattern-matching

**Why 3: Why did pattern-matching override workflow instructions?**
→ No automated validation gate enforced workflow BEFORE code creation

**Why 4: Why is there no validation gate?**
→ Workflow enforcement relies on agent self-discipline, not system constraints

**Why 5: Why does it rely on self-discipline?**
→ **🎯 ROOT CAUSE**: Workflow is **documented** but not **enforced** by tooling/automation

## 🧠 Contributing Factors

### 1. Cognitive Biases

| Bias | How It Manifested | Impact |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| **Task Framing Bias** | "Build demo" → "Implementation task" | Skipped planning phase |
| **Optimization for Visible Progress** | Code is visible, docs are "overhead" | Prioritized coding over docs |
| **Path of Least Resistance** | Easier to code than follow 5-agent workflow | Shortcut taken |
| **Hindsight Bias** | "I can document after I know what I built" | Retroactive docs lose decision value |
| **Confirmation Bias** | "User wants demo fast" → Skip docs | Ignored workflow requirements |

### 2. System Design Gaps

#### ❌ Gap 1: No Pre-Commit Validation

**Missing Hook**: `.github/hooks/pre-commit`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-commit hook to enforce AgentX workflow

# Extract issue number from commit message
COMMIT_MSG=$(cat "$1")
ISSUE_NUMBER=$(echo "$COMMIT_MSG" | grep -oP '#\K\d+')

if [ -z "$ISSUE_NUMBER" ]; then
    echo "❌ BLOCKED: No issue number in commit message"
    echo "   Format: 'type: description (#123)'"
    exit 1
fi

# Get issue type
ISSUE_TYPE=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json labels -q '.labels[] | select(.name | startswith("type:")) | .name' | head -1)

# Validate workflow documents exist
case $ISSUE_TYPE in
    "type:epic")
        if [ ! -f "docs/prd/PRD-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md" ]; then
            echo "❌ BLOCKED: Epic requires PRD before code"
            echo "   Missing: docs/prd/PRD-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md"
            exit 1
        fi
        ;;
    "type:feature")
        if [ ! -f "docs/specs/SPEC-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md" ]; then
            echo "❌ BLOCKED: Feature requires Spec before code"
            echo "   Missing: docs/specs/SPEC-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md"
            exit 1
        fi
        ;;
esac

echo "✅ Workflow validation passed"
```

**Impact**: Without this, agent could commit code without workflow compliance

---

#### ❌ Gap 2: No Label Sequence Validation

**Missing Action**: `.github/workflows/validate-label-sequence.yml`

```yaml
name: Validate Label Sequence

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  validate-sequence:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Label Progression
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const labels = context.payload.issue.labels.map(l => l.name);
            const newLabel = context.payload.label.name;
            
            // Define valid progressions
            const validProgressions = {
              'orch:pm-done': [],  // No prerequisite
              'stage:architect-done': ['orch:pm-done'],
              'stage:ux-designer-done': ['orch:pm-done'],
              'stage:engineer-done': ['stage:architect-done'],
              'stage:reviewer-done': ['stage:engineer-done']
            };
            
            if (newLabel in validProgressions) {
              const required = validProgressions[newLabel];
              const missing = required.filter(r => !labels.includes(r));
              
              if (missing.length > 0) {
                await github.rest.issues.removeLabel({
                  ...context.repo,
                  issue_number: context.issue.number,
                  name: newLabel
                });
                
                await github.rest.issues.createComment({
                  ...context.repo,
                  issue_number: context.issue.number,
                  body: `❌ Cannot add label \`${newLabel}\` without: ${missing.map(m => `\`${m}\``).join(', ')}\n\nFollow AgentX workflow progression.`
                });
                
                core.setFailed(`Invalid label sequence: ${newLabel} requires ${missing.join(', ')}`);
              }
            }
```

**Impact**: Without this, agent could add `stage:engineer-done` without `stage:architect-done`

---

#### ❌ Gap 3: No Document Existence Validation in CI

**Missing Job**: `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` (needs enhancement)

```yaml
  validate-workflow-docs:
    name: Validate Workflow Documents
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Required Documents
        run: |
          ISSUE_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          ISSUE_TYPE=$(gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json labels -q '.labels[] | select(.name | startswith("type:")) | .name' | head -1)
          
          case $ISSUE_TYPE in
            "type:epic")
              if [ ! -f "docs/prd/PRD-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md" ]; then
                echo "❌ BLOCKED: Epic requires PRD"
                exit 1
              fi
              ;;
            "type:feature")
              if [ ! -f "docs/specs/SPEC-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md" ]; then
                echo "❌ BLOCKED: Feature requires Spec"
                exit 1
              fi
              ;;
          esac
```

**Impact**: Without this, PRs could be merged without required workflow documents

---

### 3. Instruction Clarity Issues

#### Problem: Instructions Use "Advisory" Language

**Current** (copilot-instructions.md line 43-57):
```markdown
## 🚨 CRITICAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

□ Step 1: Read AGENTS.md (if not already read)
□ Step 2: Create GitHub Issue (if none exists)
□ Step 3: Claim Issue (move to In Progress in Projects)
□ Step 4: NOW you can proceed with work
```

**Analysis**:
- ❌ Uses checkbox (□) suggesting optional
- ❌ "if not already read" - allows skipping
- ❌ "NOW you can proceed" - permission, not enforcement
- ❌ No mention of consequences for non-compliance

**Better Approach**:
```markdown
## ⛔ MANDATORY GATE - SYSTEM ENFORCED

BEFORE CREATING ANY FILE:

1. ✅ **VERIFY Issue Exists**: Run `gh issue view <ID>` (pre-commit hook checks)
2. ✅ **VERIFY Type Label**: Run `gh issue view <ID> --json labels` (CI checks)
3. ✅ **VERIFY Documents**:
   - Epic → PRD must exist: `test -f docs/prd/PRD-<ID>.md`
   - Feature → Spec must exist: `test -f docs/specs/SPEC-<ID>.md`
4. ✅ **VERIFY Assignment**: Run `gh issue view <ID> --json assignees`

⚠️ **ENFORCEMENT**: Pre-commit hooks will REJECT commits without compliance
⚠️ **ENFORCEMENT**: CI will BLOCK PRs missing required documents
⚠️ **ENFORCEMENT**: Label sequence validation will REMOVE invalid labels
```

---

### 4. Agent Instruction Processing Model

#### How LLM Agents Process Instructions

```
Input: User Request ("Build Idea Management demo")
   ↓
Step 1: Load Instructions (copilot-instructions.md, AGENTS.md)
   ↓
Step 2: Parse Request → Identify Intent ("implementation task")
   ↓
Step 3: Pattern Match to Similar Tasks in Training Data
   ↓  (Training has 1000x more "build feature" than "follow workflow")
   ↓
Step 4: Generate Action Plan
   ↓
**Problem: Pattern matching (Step 3) overrides instructions (Step 1)**
   ↓
Step 5: Execute (Code generation starts)
```

**Why This Happens**:
- **Recency Bias**: Most recent similar pattern (coding) activates strongly
- **Frequency Bias**: "Build X" pattern seen thousands of times in training
- **Instruction Salience**: Workflow instructions blend into background knowledge
- **No Feedback Loop**: Agent doesn't verify compliance until user intervention

## 📊 Evidence: Existing (But Unused) Enforcement Tools

### ✅ Validation Scripts EXIST (But Weren't Called)

| Script | Purpose | Location | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| `validate-handoff.sh` | Verify agent completed required artifacts | `.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh` | ✅ Exists, **not called** |
| `validate-handoff.ps1` | Windows version of above | `.github/scripts/validate-handoff.ps1` | ✅ Exists, **not called** |
| `capture-context.sh` | Save agent context for next agent | `.github/scripts/capture-context.sh` | ✅ Exists, **not called** |
| `capture-context.ps1` | Windows version of above | `.github/scripts/capture-context.ps1` | ✅ Exists, **not called** |

**Key Finding**: All enforcement tools exist but require **manual invocation**.

**Example from engineer.agent.md** (lines 496-512):
```markdown
### Before Adding `orch:engineer-done` Label

1. ✅ **Run validation script**:
   ```bash
   ./.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh <issue_number> engineer
   ```

2. ✅ **Complete self-review checklist** ...
```

**Problem**: Agent must remember to run scripts. No automated trigger.

---

### ✅ GitHub Actions Exist (But No Enforcement)

| Workflow | Purpose | Enforcement | Gap |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----|
| `agent-orchestrator.yml` | Triggers agent workflows | ❌ Advisory | Doesn't block non-compliance |
| `quality-gates.yml` | Runs quality checks | ⚠️ Partial | Checks secrets, not workflow docs |
| `dependency-scanning.yml` | Scans dependencies | ✅ Enforced | Works well (not related to workflow) |

**Key Finding**: Quality gates check **code quality** but not **workflow compliance**.

## 🔧 Proposed Solutions (Ordered by Impact)

### Solution 1: Automated Pre-Commit Hooks (Highest Impact)

**What**: Git hooks that run locally BEFORE code is committed

**Implementation**:
```bash
# install.ps1 (already exists, enhance it)
# Copy pre-commit hook
Copy-Item ".github/hooks/pre-commit" ".git/hooks/pre-commit"
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# install.sh (already exists, enhance it)
cp .github/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Pre-Commit Hook** (`.github/hooks/pre-commit`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🔍 AgentX Workflow Validation..."

# Get commit message

        PRD_PATH="docs/prd/PRD-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md"
        if [ ! -f "$PRD_PATH" ]; then
            echo "❌ BLOCKED: Epic #$ISSUE_NUMBER requires PRD before coding"
            echo ""
            echo "Missing: $PRD_PATH"
            echo ""

    "type:story")
        # Stories can proceed with just acceptance criteria in issue
        echo "✅ Story type: Can proceed (check issue for acceptance criteria)"
        ;;

        echo "   This may indicate workflow was skipped"
    fi
fi

echo ""
echo "✅ Workflow validation passed"
echo ""
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Blocks commits without issue number
- ✅ Blocks commits without required documents (PRD for Epic, Spec for Feature)
- ✅ Runs locally (fast, immediate feedback)
- ✅ Can't be bypassed (unless `git commit --no-verify`)

**Effort**: 2 hours (script + testing)

### Solution 2: Label Sequence Validation (High Impact)

**What**: GitHub Action that removes invalid orchestration labels

**Implementation**: Create `.github/workflows/validate-label-sequence.yml`

```yaml
name: Validate Label Sequence

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  validate:
    name: Check Label Progression
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Validate Label Sequence
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const labels = context.payload.issue.labels.map(l => l.name);
            const newLabel = context.payload.label.name;
            
            console.log(`New label: ${newLabel}`);
            console.log(`Existing labels: ${labels.join(', ')}`);
            
            // Define required prerequisites
            const prerequisites = {
              'orch:pm-done': null,  // No prerequisite
              'stage:architect-done': 'orch:pm-done',
              'stage:ux-designer-done': 'orch:pm-done',
              'stage:engineer-done': 'stage:architect-done',
              'stage:reviewer-done': 'stage:engineer-done'
            };
            
            if (newLabel in prerequisites) {
              const required = prerequisites[newLabel];
              
              if (required && !labels.includes(required)) {
                // Remove the invalid label
                await github.rest.issues.removeLabel({
                  ...context.repo,
                  issue_number: context.issue.number,
                  name: newLabel
                });
                
                // Post explanatory comment
                await github.rest.issues.createComment({
                  ...context.repo,
                  issue_number: context.issue.number,
                  body: `## ❌ Invalid Workflow Progression\n\n` +
                        `Cannot add label \`${newLabel}\` without prerequisite: \`${required}\`\n\n` +
                        `**AgentX Workflow**:\n` +
                        `1. PM completes → adds \`orch:pm-done\`\n` +
                        `2. Architect completes → adds \`stage:architect-done\`\n` +
                        `3. Engineer completes → adds \`stage:engineer-done\`\n` +
                        `4. Reviewer completes → adds \`stage:reviewer-done\`\n\n` +
                        `Label \`${newLabel}\` has been removed. Complete prerequisite stage first.`
                });
                
                core.setFailed(`Invalid label sequence`);
              } else {
                console.log('✅ Label sequence valid');
              }
            }
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Enforces label order automatically
- ✅ Provides clear feedback to user/agent
- ✅ Can't skip workflow stages
- ✅ Runs in <5 seconds

**Effort**: 1 hour (workflow + testing)

### Solution 3: Enhanced Copilot Instructions (Medium Impact)

**What**: Rewrite instructions to be more directive and include verification steps

**Current** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` lines 43-57):
```markdown
## 🚨 CRITICAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

□ Step 1: Read AGENTS.md (if not already read)
□ Step 2: Create GitHub Issue (if none exists)
□ Step 3: Claim Issue (move to In Progress in Projects)
□ Step 4: NOW you can proceed with work
```

**Replacement**:
```markdown
## ⛔⛔⛔ STOP - VERIFY BEFORE CODING ⛔⛔⛔

You MUST run these verification commands BEFORE creating any code files:

### Step 1: Verify Issue Exists
```bash
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER>
```
**If command fails**: Create issue first with `gh issue create`

### Step 2: Verify Issue Has Type Label
```bash
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --json labels -q '.labels[].name' | grep "type:"
```
**If no type label**: Add one with `gh issue edit <ISSUE_NUMBER> --add-label "type:story"`

### Step 3: Verify Prerequisite Documents Exist

**For type:epic**:
```bash
test -f docs/prd/PRD-<ISSUE_NUMBER>.md && echo "✅ PRD exists" || echo "❌ BLOCKED: Create PRD first"
```

**For type:feature**:
```bash
test -f docs/specs/SPEC-<ISSUE_NUMBER>.md && echo "✅ Spec exists" || echo "❌ BLOCKED: Create Spec first"
```

**If document missing**: Run appropriate agent (PM for PRD, Architect for Spec) BEFORE coding

### Step 4: Verify You Are Assigned
```bash
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --json assignees
```
**If not assigned**: Assign yourself with `gh issue edit <ISSUE_NUMBER> --add-assignee "@me"`

---

## ⚠️ ENFORCEMENT

- **Pre-commit hook** will BLOCK commits without issue number
- **Pre-commit hook** will BLOCK commits without required documents
- **CI workflow** will FAIL PRs missing workflow documents
- **Label validation** will REMOVE invalid orchestration labels

**You CANNOT bypass workflow compliance** - automation enforces it.

---

## ✅ After Verification Passes

Only after ALL verifications pass:
1. Read relevant skill documentation from `.github/skills/`
2. Create implementation plan
3. Write code following AgentX standards
4. Write tests (80%+ coverage)
5. Commit with message: `type: description (#<ISSUE_NUMBER>)`
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Clearer instructions with actual commands to run
- ✅ Emphasizes automation enforcement
- ✅ No ambiguity about "when" to check

**Effort**: 30 minutes (rewrite + review)

---

### Solution 4: Workflow State Tracking (Lower Impact, Higher Complexity)

**What**: GitHub issue field that tracks current workflow stage

**Implementation**: Use GitHub Projects custom fields

```yaml
# .github/workflows/track-workflow-stage.yml
name: Track Workflow Stage

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  update-stage:

      - name: Update Project Stage Field
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const newLabel = context.payload.label.name;
            
            // Map labels to stages
            const stageMap = {
              'orch:pm-done': 'Product Planning',
              'stage:architect-done': 'Architecture',
              'stage:ux-designer-done': 'UX Design',
              'stage:engineer-done': 'Implementation',
              'stage:reviewer-done': 'Review'
            };
            
            if (newLabel in stageMap) {
              // Update GitHub Projects field (requires GraphQL)
              const projectField = 'Workflow Stage';
              const newValue = stageMap[newLabel];
              
              // GraphQL mutation to update field
              // (Implementation details omitted for brevity)
              
              console.log(`Updated stage to: ${newValue}`);
            }
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Visual workflow tracking in Projects board
- ✅ Easier to see which issues are stuck
- ⚠️ Doesn't prevent violations, just tracks them

**Effort**: 4 hours (GraphQL integration + testing)

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1)

#### Day 1: Pre-Commit Hooks
1. **Create** `.github/hooks/pre-commit` (bash script from Solution 1)
2. **Create** `.github/hooks/pre-commit.ps1` (PowerShell version)
3. **Update** `install.ps1` to copy hooks
4. **Update** `install.sh` to copy hooks
5. **Test** with intentional violations (no issue, no PRD)
6. **Document** in CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Day 2: Label Validation
1. **Create** `.github/workflows/validate-label-sequence.yml`
2. **Test** by manually adding labels out of order
3. **Verify** action removes invalid labels
4. **Verify** action posts explanatory comment
5. **Document** in AGENTS.md

#### Day 3: Enhanced Instructions
1. **Rewrite** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` sections 43-130
2. **Add** explicit verification commands
3. **Emphasize** enforcement (not advisory)
4. **Review** with team
5. **Commit** changes

#### Day 4: Testing & Documentation
1. **Create** test issue #999 (test workflow)
2. **Attempt** to violate workflow (should be blocked)
3. **Verify** all enforcement mechanisms work
4. **Document** lessons learned in this RCA
5. **Create** "Workflow Enforcement" section in README

---

### Phase 2: Enhanced (Week 2)

#### Week 2: Advanced Enforcement
1. **Enhance** `quality-gates.yml` to check workflow documents
2. **Add** document schema validation (PRD has all 12 sections)
3. **Create** GitHub Action to auto-assign next agent
4. **Add** Slack/email notifications for workflow violations
5. **Create** dashboard showing workflow compliance metrics

## 🧪 Validation Criteria

### How to Know Solutions Work

**Test Case 1: Epic Without PRD**
```bash
# Setup
gh issue create --title "[Epic] Test Workflow" --label "type:epic"
# Expected: Issue #100 created

# Attempt to commit code
git add src/TestFile.cs
git commit -m "feat: implement test (#100)"
# Expected: ❌ BLOCKED - "Epic #100 requires PRD before coding"

# Create PRD
touch docs/prd/PRD-100.md
# Add minimal content...

# Retry commit
git commit -m "feat: implement test (#100)"
# Expected: ✅ Commit succeeds
```

**Test Case 2: Label Sequence Violation**
```bash
# Setup
gh issue create --title "[Epic] Test" --label "type:epic"
# Expected: Issue #101 created

# Add engineer-done without architect-done
gh issue edit 101 --add-label "stage:engineer-done"
# Expected: Label removed within 5 seconds, comment posted

# Add labels in order
gh issue edit 101 --add-label "orch:pm-done"
gh issue edit 101 --add-label "stage:architect-done"
gh issue edit 101 --add-label "stage:engineer-done"
# Expected: All labels stay (valid sequence)
```

**Test Case 3: Agent Follows Workflow**
```bash
# User request: "Build new authentication feature"
# Agent should:
1. Create issue #102 with type:feature
2. Read AGENTS.md, understand Feature workflow
3. Create Spec at docs/specs/SPEC-102.md (Architect)
4. Implement code (Engineer)
5. Run tests, achieve 80%+ coverage
6. Add orchestration labels in sequence
7. Close issue with summary

# All steps should pass pre-commit and CI checks
```

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### For AgentX Framework

1. **Documentation ≠ Enforcement**: Having great docs doesn't ensure compliance
2. **Agent Discipline ≠ Reliable**: Agents forget, agents shortcut, agents optimize wrong metrics
3. **Local Enforcement > Remote**: Pre-commit hooks catch violations before push
4. **Fast Feedback > Perfect Feedback**: 5-second label validation better than daily review
5. **Automation > Human Review**: Humans miss violations, automation doesn't

### For AI Agents

1. **Pattern Matching Wins**: Without enforcement, agents revert to training patterns ("just code")
2. **Recency Bias**: Most recent similar task activates strongly (overrides instructions)
3. **Instruction Salience**: "Critical" headers blend into background without enforcement
4. **Verification is Key**: Agents must run verification commands, not just read instructions
5. **Feedback Loops Matter**: Without immediate rejection, agents learn wrong behavior

### For Future Work

1. **Design for Non-Compliance**: Assume agents will forget, design systems that prevent it
2. **Fail Fast**: Block violations at earliest possible point (pre-commit, not PR review)
3. **Clear Consequences**: "BLOCKED" is clearer than "you should have..."
4. **Automate Everything**: If a check can be automated, automate it
5. **Measure Compliance**: Track workflow violations as a metric

## 📊 Appendix: Compliance Metrics (Post-Fix)

### Before Solutions (Issue #88)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Workflow Violations** | 1 (100% of Epics) |
| **Time to Detect** | 6 hours (manual) |
| **Documents Created Retroactively** | 5 (PRD, ADR, Spec, UX, Review) |
| **Agent Self-Correction** | No (required user intervention) |
| **Enforcement** | Manual only |

### After Solutions (Target)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Workflow Violations** | 0 (100% compliance) |
| **Time to Detect** | <1 second (pre-commit) |
| **Documents Created Retroactively** | 0 (all created before code) |
| **Agent Self-Correction** | Yes (blocked by automation) |
| **Enforcement** | Automated (hooks + CI + label validation) |
