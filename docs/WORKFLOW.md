## Critical Workflow

### Before ANY Work

1. **Research** codebase (`semantic_search`, `grep_search`, `file_search`)
2. **Classify** request (Epic/Feature/Story/Bug/Spike/Docs)
3. **Create Issue** with type label
4. **Execute** role-specific work
5. **Update Status** in GitHub Projects V2 (or local file in Local Mode)

### Issue-First Flow

Every piece of work -- bug fix, feature, docs update -- **SHOULD** start with an issue.

**Why issue-first?** Agents rely on issues for routing, status tracking, and handoffs. The ready queue sorts by priority. Commits reference issues for traceability. Without an issue, nothing can be routed or reviewed.

**Issue enforcement by mode:**
- **GitHub Mode**: Issue references in commits are **required** by default (teams need traceability)
- **Local Mode**: Issue references are **optional** by default (solo developers can commit freely)
- To toggle enforcement: `.agentx/agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues true` (or `false`)

**GitHub Mode:**
```bash
gh issue create --title "[Story] Add /health endpoint" --label "type:story"  # Creates #42
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 ready                        # Pick from ready queue
# Work... then commit:
git commit -m "feat: add health endpoint (#42)"
gh issue close 42 --reason completed
```

**Local Mode:**
```powershell
# Issues are optional in local mode - you can commit without issue references
git commit -m "feat: add user login"

# Or use full issue workflow if preferred:
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action create -Title "[Bug] Fix timeout" -Labels "type:bug"
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "In Progress"
git commit -m "fix: resolve login timeout (#1)"
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action close -IssueNumber 1

# Enable issue enforcement in local mode:
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues true
```

**Emergency bypass (GitHub mode)**: Add `[skip-issue]` to the commit message for hotfixes. Create a retroactive issue afterward.

> **Status Tracking**: Use GitHub Projects V2 **Status** field (GitHub mode) or local JSON status (Local mode).
> See [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md#local-mode-no-github) for local mode details.

## Architecture

### Hub-and-Spoke Pattern

AgentX uses a **Hub-and-Spoke architecture** for agent coordination:

```
                        Agent X (Hub)
                             |
              +--------------+--------------+
              |              |              |
         PM Agent     (PRD complete)        |
              |              |              |
    +---------+---------+    |              |
    |         |         |    |              |
 Architect  Data     UX     |              |
  Agent   Scientist Agent   |              |
    |         |         |    |              |
    +---------+---------+    |              |
              |              |              |
         Engineer Agent      |              |
              |              |              |
         Reviewer Agent      |              |
              |              |              |
    +---------+---------+    |              |
    |                   |    |              |
  DevOps Agent    Tester Agent              |
    |                   |    |              |
    +---------+---------+    |              |
              |              |              |
    Engineer (bug fixes) <---+     Customer Coach
                                  (standalone)
```

**Standalone Agents** (outside SDLC pipeline):

```
  Agile Coach    Customer Coach    Power BI Analyst
     |               |                  |
  (Stories)       (Research)         (Reports)
```

**Invisible Sub-Agents** (spawned by parent agents):

```
  Agent X -------> GitHub Ops (GitHub backlog management)
  Agent X -------> ADO Ops (ADO backlog management)
  PM -------------> GitHub Ops (child issue creation)
  PM -------------> ADO Ops (work item creation)
  Reviewer ------> GitHub Ops (issue status/labels)
  Reviewer ------> ADO Ops (work item status)
  Reviewer ------> Functional Reviewer (branch diff analysis)
  Reviewer ------> Eval Specialist (AI model quality review)
  Tester --------> GitHub Ops (defect issue creation)
  Tester --------> ADO Ops (defect work item creation)
  Data Scientist -> Prompt Engineer (prompt lifecycle)
  Data Scientist -> Eval Specialist (evaluation pipelines)
  Data Scientist -> Ops Monitor (AgentOps + drift)
  Data Scientist -> RAG Specialist (retrieval pipelines)
  Engineer -------> Prompt Engineer (needs:ai prompt work)
  Engineer -------> RAG Specialist (needs:ai RAG implementation)
  DevOps ---------> Ops Monitor (deployment monitoring)
```

**Key Principles:**

1. **Centralized Coordination** - Agent X routes all work, validates prerequisites, handles errors
2. **Strict Role Separation** - Each agent produces one deliverable type (PRD, ADR, Code, Review)
3. **Universal Tool Access** - All agents have access to all tools for maximum flexibility
4. **Status-Driven** - GitHub Projects V2 Status field is the source of truth
5. **Pre-Handoff Validation** - Artifacts validated before status transitions
6. **Post-Review Validation** - DevOps and Tester validate in parallel after Reviewer approves
7. **Bug-Fix Feedback Loop** - Tester defects route back to Engineer for resolution

### Routing Logic

Agent X routes issues based on:
- **Issue type** (Epic, Feature, Story, Bug, Spike)
- **Status** (Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Ready, Done)
- **Labels** (needs:ux, needs:changes, etc.)
- **Prerequisites** (PRD exists, UX complete, Spec ready)

**Routing rules:**
```
Epic + Backlog -> Product Manager
Ready + needs:ux -> UX Designer (parallel with Architect, Data Scientist)
Ready + (no architecture) -> Architect (parallel with UX, Data Scientist)
Ready + type:data-science -> Data Scientist (parallel with Architect, UX)
Ready + (has architecture) -> Engineer
needs:iteration -> Engineer (extended iterative-loop workflow, max 20)
In Review -> Reviewer
Reviewer approved -> DevOps Engineer + Tester (parallel post-review validation)
Tester defects found -> Engineer (bug-fix feedback loop)
Bug + Backlog -> Engineer (skip PM/Architect)
Spike + Backlog -> Architect
type:devops + Backlog -> DevOps Engineer (skip PM/Architect for infrastructure work)
type:data-science + Backlog -> Data Scientist (skip PM/Architect for ML/AI work)
type:testing + Backlog -> Tester (skip PM/Architect for testing/certification work)
type:powerbi + Backlog -> Power BI Analyst (skip PM/Architect for report/dashboard work)
In Review + needs:testing -> Tester (pre-release certification)
```

**Autonomous Mode**: For simple tasks (bugs, docs, stories <=3 files), Agent X can automatically route to Engineer, skipping manual coordination. See [Agent X](../.github/agents/agent-x.agent.md) (mode: adaptive).

**Universal Iterative Refinement**: ALL workflows include `iterate = true` on the Engineer's implementation step by default. The Reviewer ALWAYS verifies loop completion before approval. The `needs:iteration` label is reserved for **extended** iteration (max 20 iterations). See [Iterative Loop Skill](../.github/skills/development/iterative-loop/SKILL.md).

### Validation

**Pre-handoff validation** ensures quality before status transitions:

```bash
# Validate before handoff
./.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh <issue_number> <role>

# Example
./.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh 100 pm
```

**Validation checks:**
- PM: PRD exists, child issues created, required sections present
- UX: Wireframes + user flows + **HTML/CSS prototypes (MANDATORY)** complete, accessibility considered
- Architect: ADR + Tech Spec exist, NO CODE EXAMPLES compliance
- Data Scientist: ML pipeline design, evaluation plan, model card present
- Engineer: Code committed, tests 80% coverage, docs updated
- Reviewer: Review document complete, approval decision present
- DevOps: CI/CD pipelines validated, deployment docs present
- Tester: Test suites pass, certification report complete
- Power BI Analyst: Semantic model validated, DAX measures tested, report spec documented

## Orchestration Modes

| Mode | How It Works | Platform |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Mode 1: Agent X Hub** | Agent X body text + `runSubagent` calls route work through PM -> [Architect, UX, Data Scientist] -> Engineer -> Reviewer -> [DevOps, Tester] | VS Code, Claude Code |
| **Mode 2: Human-Orchestrated** | User picks agent from Copilot agent picker; `handoffs:` frontmatter renders "Hand off to X" buttons | VS Code |
| **CLI Standalone** | `agentx.ps1 run <agent> <task>` runs agent via GitHub Models API; no sub-agent chaining | CLI |

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

Agents use Copilot's built-in `runSubagent` tool. Body text instructs: read artifacts first,
spawn target agent with full context, max 3 follow-up exchanges, escalate to user if unresolved.
Scope is controlled by `agents:` frontmatter (which agents can be spawned).

### Self-Review Loop

Body text in every agent instructs: "Before handoff, spawn a same-role reviewer sub-agent."
Reviewer produces structured findings ([HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW]). Agent addresses HIGH/MEDIUM
findings, then re-runs. Copilot executes this natively via `runSubagent`.

---

## Handoff Flow

```
PM -> [Architect, Data Scientist, UX] (parallel) -> Engineer -> Reviewer -> [DevOps, Tester] (parallel) -> Engineer (bug fixes)
```

**Parallel Design Phase**: Architect, Data Scientist, and UX Designer work simultaneously after PM completes PRD.
**Parallel Validation Phase**: DevOps Engineer and Tester validate in parallel after Reviewer approves.
**Bug-Fix Feedback Loop**: Tester defects route back to Engineer for resolution before closing.

> **Note**: Customer Coach, Power BI Analyst, and Agile Coach operate **standalone** (not part of the core SDLC pipeline). GitHub Ops, ADO Ops, Functional Reviewer, Prompt Engineer, Eval Specialist, Ops Monitor, and RAG Specialist are invisible sub-agents spawned by their parent agents.

### Backlog-Based Handoffs

Agents query the backlog for the next priority item instead of receiving explicit issue numbers.

| Agent | Picks Up |
|-------|----------|
| **UX Designer** | Status=`Ready` + `needs:ux`, sorted by priority |
| **Architect** | Status=`Ready` + PRD complete, sorted by priority |
| **Engineer** | Status=`Ready` + ADR/Spec complete, sorted by priority |
| **Reviewer** | Status=`In Review`, sorted by priority |
| **DevOps** | `type:devops` + Status=`Ready`, sorted by priority |
| **Data Scientist** | `type:data-science` + Status=`Ready`, sorted by priority |
| **Tester** | `type:testing` + Status=`Ready` or `In Review` + `needs:testing`, sorted by priority |
| **Power BI Analyst** | `type:powerbi` + Status=`Ready`, sorted by priority |

**Priority Order**: `priority:p0` > `priority:p1` > `priority:p2` > `priority:p3` > (no label)

If no matching issues found, agent reports "No [role] work pending."

### Context Management

Clear context before implementation phase to prevent design assumptions from leaking into code.

| Transition | Clear? | Reason |
|------------|--------|--------|
| PM -> UX/Architect/Data Scientist | No | Needs PRD context |
| UX/Architect/Data Scientist -> Engineer | **Yes** | Engineer follows spec only |
| Engineer -> Reviewer | No | Reviewer needs full context |
| Reviewer -> DevOps/Tester | No | Needs review context |
| Tester -> Engineer (bug fixes) | No | Needs defect details |
| Reviewer -> Engineer (rework) | No | Needs review feedback |

### Status Transitions

| Phase | Status Transition | Meaning |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| PM completes PRD | -> `Ready` | Ready for design/architecture |
| UX completes designs | -> `Ready` | Ready for implementation |
| Architect completes spec | -> `Ready` | Ready for implementation |
| Data Scientist completes ML design | -> `Ready` | Ready for implementation |
| Engineer starts work | -> `In Progress` | Active development |
| Engineer completes code | -> `In Review` | Ready for code review |
| Reviewer approves | -> `Validating` | Ready for post-review validation |
| DevOps + Tester validate | -> `Done` + Close | Work complete (or back to Engineer for bug fixes) |

### Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| `Backlog` | Issue created, not started |
| `In Progress` | Active work by Engineer |
| `In Review` | Code review phase |
| `Validating` | Post-review validation by DevOps + Tester |
| `Ready` | Design/spec done, awaiting next phase |
| `Done` | Completed and closed |
