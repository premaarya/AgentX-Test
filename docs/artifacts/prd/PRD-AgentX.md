## 1. Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) are powerful but undisciplined -- they skip planning, write code without specifications, produce inconsistent deliverables, and ignore documentation. There is no structured way to coordinate multiple AI agents through a real software development lifecycle (SDLC) with role separation, quality gates, and traceability.

### Why is this important?

- **Quality**: Unstructured AI output leads to unmaintainable code, missing tests, and security gaps.
- **Traceability**: Without issue-first workflows, work cannot be tracked, reviewed, or audited.
- **Team Simulation**: Solo developers and small teams lack the structured workflow discipline that larger teams enforce through process. AI agents can fill these roles if properly orchestrated.
- **Competitive Advantage**: AgentX is the first open-source multi-agent orchestration framework that brings hub-and-spoke agent coordination to GitHub Copilot with standardized deliverables.

### What happens if we don't solve this?

AI assistants continue to produce ad-hoc, unstructured output. Developers get code without PRDs, architecture without decision records, and implementations without test coverage. The gap between "AI-generated code" and "production-ready software" remains wide.

#### Won't Have (Out of Scope)

- Hosted/SaaS version of AgentX (remains open-source, local-first)
- GUI-only experience without VS Code (VS Code is the primary interface)
- Integration with non-Git version control systems
- Real-time collaborative multi-user agent sessions

### 4.2 AI/ML Requirements

#### Technology Classification
- [x] **Hybrid** - rule-based foundation with AI/ML enhancement

AgentX itself is a **rule-based orchestration framework** that coordinates AI-powered agents. The agents rely on underlying LLM capabilities (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) for generation, but the framework's routing, validation, and workflow logic is deterministic.

#### Model Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Model Type** | LLM (text generation via GitHub Copilot / Claude / GPT) |
| **Provider** | Any (GitHub Copilot Chat is primary; Claude, OpenAI, Google compatible) |
| **Latency** | Near-real-time (<10s for chat responses) |
| **Quality Threshold** | Agent deliverables must pass handoff validation |
| **Cost Budget** | User-managed (depends on Copilot subscription) |
| **Data Sensitivity** | Code and documentation (user-controlled, local-first) |

#### Inference Pattern
- [x] Agent with tools (function calling / tool use)
- [x] Multi-agent orchestration (sequential / hierarchical)

#### Data Requirements
- **Training / Evaluation data**: N/A (uses pre-trained models)
- **Grounding data**: AGENTS.md, Skills.md, templates, instruction files loaded as context
- **Data sensitivity**: User source code (local-first, no telemetry)
- **Volume**: Interactive usage (10-50 agent interactions per session)

#### AI-Specific Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Agents produce deliverables matching template structure
- [x] Context budget stays within model window limits
- [x] Progressive disclosure keeps token usage under 20K per task
- [x] Graceful degradation when underlying LLM is unavailable (CLI still works)

### 4.3 Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **Response Time**: CLI commands complete in <3 seconds; chat responses flow in <10 seconds
- **Throughput**: Single-user interactive usage (not a server)
- **Uptime**: N/A (local tool, not a service)

#### Security
- **Authentication**: GitHub CLI (`gh auth`) for GitHub mode; none for local mode
- **Authorization**: Role-based boundaries (agents can only modify designated file paths)
- **Data Protection**: All data stays local; no telemetry; no external API calls from framework
- **Compliance**: MIT license; OpenSSF Scorecard tracked

#### Scalability
- **Concurrent Users**: Single-user per VS Code instance
- **Data Volume**: Designed for repositories up to 100K+ files
- **Growth**: Plugin system and pack bundles enable horizontal extension

#### Usability
- **Accessibility**: VS Code native accessibility support
- **Platform Support**: Windows (PowerShell 5.1+/7+), macOS (bash), Linux (bash)
- **Install Time**: Zero-prompt local install in under 60 seconds
- **Onboarding**: 5-minute quickstart guide (docs/GUIDE.md)

#### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Critical pre-check with auto-install of missing dependencies
- **Recovery**: Shell fallback (pwsh -> powershell.exe on Windows)
- **Monitoring**: Structured thinking log, event bus, context budget reports

## 6. User Flows

### Primary Flow: Issue-First Feature Development

**Trigger**: Developer wants to build a new feature
**Preconditions**: AgentX installed and initialized in workspace

**Steps**:
1. Developer creates an issue (local or GitHub) with type label (e.g., `type:epic`)
2. Agent X detects the issue type and routes to Product Manager
3. PM Agent creates PRD at `docs/artifacts/prd/PRD-{issue}.md` with template
4. PM moves issue to Ready status; Agent X routes to UX Designer and Architect (parallel)
5. UX Agent creates wireframes + HTML/CSS prototypes at `docs/ux/`
6. Architect Agent creates ADR + Tech Spec at `docs/artifacts/adr/` and `docs/artifacts/specs/`
7. Both agents move to Ready; Agent X routes to Engineer
8. Engineer Agent implements code + tests (80%+ coverage) with iterative refinement
9. Engineer moves issue to In Review; Agent X routes to Reviewer
10. Reviewer Agent creates review document; approves or requests changes
11. **Success State**: Issue moved to Done, all deliverables committed

**Alternative Flows**:
- **6a. Simple Bug**: Agent X skips PM/Architect, routes directly to Engineer
- **6b. Review Rejection**: Reviewer adds `needs:changes` label, issue returns to Engineer
- **6c. Extended Iteration**: Engineer uses `needs:iteration` label for up to 20 refinement cycles

### Secondary Flow: VS Code Chat Interaction

**Trigger**: Developer types `@agentx` in Copilot Chat
**Preconditions**: Extension activated, workspace contains AGENTS.md

**Steps**:
1. Developer types `@agentx /workflow feature`
2. Chat participant loads agent context (AGENTS.md, relevant skills)
3. Agent router determines the appropriate agent role
4. Agent produces deliverable using templates and skills
5. Developer reviews output in chat and confirms
6. **Success State**: Deliverable created, issue updated

### Tertiary Flow: CLI Workflow Execution

**Trigger**: Developer runs CLI command
**Preconditions**: AgentX CLI available, config.json exists

**Steps**:
1. Developer runs `.agentx/agentx.ps1 ready`
2. CLI reads config.json to detect mode (local/github)
3. CLI queries issues, filters by status and priority
4. CLI displays unblocked work sorted by priority
5. Developer picks an issue; runs `.agentx/agentx.ps1 workflow -Type feature`
6. **Success State**: Workflow steps displayed, agent work initiated

## Feature PRD: Agent-to-Agent Clarification Protocol

> Originally PRD-9.md | Epic #1 | Priority: p1 | Status: Draft | Date: 2026-02-26


### 1. Problem Statement

#### What problem are we solving?

AgentX uses a strictly unidirectional handoff pipeline (PM -> UX/Architect -> Engineer -> Reviewer). When a downstream agent encounters ambiguity -- an unclear requirement, a questionable design decision, or a missing constraint -- it has no mechanism to seek clarification from the upstream agent that produced the artifact. The agent either guesses (producing incorrect output), stalls, or builds on assumptions that may be wrong.

#### Why is this important?

- **Quality**: In human teams, 30-50% of productive work happens in clarification conversations. Without feedback loops, agents produce work based on assumptions that compound into incorrect implementations.
- **Efficiency**: Incorrect assumptions discovered late (during review or testing) force expensive rework cycles. Early clarification prevents this.
- **Realism**: Real software teams don't work in one-way waterfalls. Architects ask PMs about requirements, Engineers discuss design tradeoffs with Architects. AgentX's agent model should reflect this.
- **Traceability**: Clarification conversations create a decision record that explains _why_ certain choices were made, not just _what_ was built.

#### What happens if we don't solve this?

Agents continue to guess when they encounter ambiguity. The Architect builds the wrong abstraction because a requirement was vague. The Engineer implements something the Architect didn't intend because the spec was ambiguous. The Reviewer sends work back that could have been caught with a single clarification round. Quality degrades as issue complexity increases.

---

### 2. Target Users

#### Primary Users

**User Persona 1: AgentX Developer (Observer)**
- **Goals**: Watch agents collaborate effectively without manual intervention; intervene only when escalated
- **Pain Points**: Currently has to manually re-run agents when assumptions were wrong; no visibility into where agents got stuck
- **Behaviors**: Uses `@agentx` in Copilot Chat or CLI to trigger workflows; monitors progress in sidebar tree views

**User Persona 2: AgentX Agents (Participants)**
- **Goals**: Get answers to blocking ambiguities from the agent that produced the upstream artifact; continue work without guessing
- **Pain Points**: No protocol for asking questions; can only read artifacts and hope they're complete
- **Behaviors**: Follow workflow TOML steps; read upstream deliverables (PRD, ADR, Spec); produce downstream deliverables

#### Secondary Users

- **AgentX Framework Contributors**: Need to understand and extend the clarification protocol
- **Technical Leads**: Want audit trails of agent clarification decisions for complex projects

---

### 3. Goals & Success Metrics

#### Business Goals

1. **Reduce Rework**: Decrease review rejection rate by enabling upstream clarification before implementation
2. **Improve Output Quality**: Agents resolve ambiguity through structured conversation rather than guessing
3. **Maintain Autonomy**: Human intervention required only for genuine escalations, not routine clarifications

#### Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Review rejection rate due to requirement misunderstanding | Unmeasured (high for complex issues) | <15% | Phase 3 |
| Agent rework cycles per issue (average) | Unmeasured | <1.5 | Phase 3 |
| Clarification auto-resolution rate | N/A (0%) | >80% resolved without human | Phase 2 |
| Escalation rate (requires human) | N/A | <20% of clarifications | Phase 3 |
| Clarification rounds per resolution (average) | N/A | 2-3 rounds | Phase 2 |

#### User Success Criteria

- An agent can request and receive clarification from an upstream agent within the same workflow execution
- The conversation is visible in Copilot Chat (streamed inline) or CLI (terminal log) -- no separate UI
- Escalation to human happens automatically when agents cannot resolve after max rounds
- Clarification works identically in Local Mode and GitHub Mode

---

### 4. Requirements

#### 4.1 Functional Requirements

##### Must Have (P0)

1. **Clarification Ledger (File-Based Storage)**
   - **User Story**: As Agent X, I want a persistent record of all clarification conversations so that I can track state, detect issues, and provide audit trails
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Clarification ledger stored per issue at `.agentx/state/clarifications/issue-{n}.json`
     - [ ] Each clarification record has: id, from, to, topic, blocking flag, status (pending/answered/resolved/stale/escalated/abandoned), round count, maxRounds, timestamps, thread array
     - [ ] Thread array contains typed entries: question, answer, resolution
     - [ ] Works identically in Local Mode and GitHub Mode
     - [ ] In GitHub Mode, clarification rounds also posted as structured issue comments

2. **Clarification Routing via Agent X**
   - **User Story**: As an agent (Engineer, Architect), I want to request clarification from a specific upstream agent so that I can resolve ambiguity before proceeding
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Agent X routes all clarification requests -- agents never communicate directly
     - [ ] Routing scoped by `can_clarify` field in workflow TOML steps
     - [ ] Target agent invoked via `runSubagent` with full context (question, upstream artifact, issue context)
     - [ ] Target agent's response injected back into requesting agent's context
     - [ ] Hub-and-spoke pattern preserved (Agent X as central coordinator)

3. **Round Limits and Escalation**
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want automatic escalation when agents cannot resolve a clarification so that I don't have to monitor every conversation
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Blocking clarifications: max 5 rounds (configurable via `clarify_max_rounds` in TOML)
     - [ ] Non-blocking suggestions: max 6 rounds
     - [ ] After max rounds exhausted, status auto-set to `escalated`
     - [ ] Escalation includes: topic summary, positions of both agents, recommended options
     - [ ] Escalated clarifications displayed in chat stream / CLI output for human decision

4. **File-Level Locking (Concurrent Access)**
   - **User Story**: As a framework, I need safe concurrent access to JSON state files so that two agents writing simultaneously don't corrupt data
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Lock files (`.lock` suffix) used for all state file writes
     - [ ] Atomic create via `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` (fail if lock exists)
     - [ ] Stale lock detection: locks older than 30 seconds auto-removed (dead process)
     - [ ] Retry with exponential backoff: 5 retries, 200ms base, 5 second max wait
     - [ ] Lock files listed in `.gitignore` -- never committed
     - [ ] PowerShell implementation (`Lock-JsonFile`/`Unlock-JsonFile`) for CLI
     - [ ] TypeScript implementation (`JsonFileLock.withLock()`) for VS Code extension
     - [ ] In-process `AsyncMutex` in extension for same-process concurrency

5. **Agent Status Extensions**
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want to see when agents are clarifying or blocked-on-clarification so that I know what's happening
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Two new agent statuses: `clarifying` (answering a request) and `blocked-clarification` (waiting for answer)
     - [ ] `agent-status.json` entries include `clarificationId` and `waitingOn`/`respondingTo` fields when in these states
     - [ ] Statuses reflected in `agentx state` CLI command and Agent Tree sidebar view

6. **Conversation-as-Interface (Chat + CLI)**
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want to see clarification conversations inline in Copilot Chat or CLI output so that I don't need a separate UI
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] In Copilot Chat: clarification rounds streamed as markdown in the existing chat response (`[Agent -> TargetAgent] Clarification:` format)
     - [ ] In CLI: clarification rounds printed as terminal output (`agentx.ps1 clarify --issue N`)
     - [ ] No buttons, panels, or separate views -- the conversation stream is the interface
     - [ ] Escalation appears as a distinct block in the stream with summary + action needed

##### Should Have (P1)

1. **Stale/Stuck Detection (Monitoring)**
   - **User Story**: As Agent X, I want to detect stale and stuck clarifications so that they don't block progress indefinitely
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] SLA timer per clarification (configurable, default 30 minutes via `clarify_sla_minutes` in TOML)
     - [ ] Stale detection: `status = pending` + time > `staleAfter` triggers auto-retry (1x via re-invoking target agent)
     - [ ] Stuck detection: circular answers (same topic, direction flipped in last 2 rounds)
     - [ ] Deadlock detection: two agents have blocking clarifications pointing at each other
     - [ ] Deadlock resolution: priority-break by upstream precedence (PM > Architect > Engineer)
     - [ ] Abandoned detection: requesting agent moved to different work without resolving

2. **Event-Driven Monitoring (No Background Daemon)**
   - **User Story**: As the system, I want monitoring to run automatically at workflow boundaries so that no background process is needed
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Monitor logic runs as side-effect of: `hook start`, `hook finish`, `ready` command, and every `clarify` subcommand
     - [ ] No background daemon or cron job required -- works in Local Mode without extra setup
     - [ ] In extension, `TaskScheduler` can optionally run periodic checks for enhanced monitoring

3. **CLI `clarify` Subcommand**
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want a CLI command to view and manage clarifications so that I have full control from the terminal
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `agentx clarify` -- list all active clarifications
     - [ ] `agentx clarify --issue N` -- show clarification thread for issue
     - [ ] `agentx clarify stale` -- show only stale/stuck clarifications
     - [ ] `agentx clarify resolve CLR-N-NNN` -- manually resolve an escalated clarification
     - [ ] `agentx clarify escalate CLR-N-NNN` -- manually escalate
     - [ ] Output format matches existing CLI style (ANSI colors, structured layout)
     - [ ] `--json` flag for machine-readable output

4. **Workflow TOML Integration**
   - **User Story**: As a framework maintainer, I want clarification rules declared in workflow TOML so that they're configurable per workflow
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `can_clarify` field on workflow steps: array of agent names the step can clarify with
     - [ ] `clarify_max_rounds` field: integer (default 5)
     - [ ] `clarify_sla_minutes` field: integer (default 30)
     - [ ] `clarify_blocking_allowed` field: boolean (default true)
     - [ ] TOML parser updated to read and validate these fields

5. **Agentic Loop Integration (Extension)**
   - **User Story**: As the extension, I want the agentic loop to detect ambiguity and trigger clarification automatically so that the UX is seamless
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `LoopConfig` extended with `canClarify`, `clarifyMaxRounds`, `onClarificationNeeded` callback
     - [ ] When LLM response signals ambiguity, loop pauses and invokes clarification protocol
     - [ ] Clarification round streamed to `response.markdown()` in chat
     - [ ] On resolution, answer injected into conversation context and loop resumes
     - [ ] On escalation, loop emits final text with escalation summary and exits

6. **EventBus Clarification Events**
   - **User Story**: As the extension, I want typed events for clarification lifecycle so that tree views and other UI components can react
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] New events: `clarification-requested`, `clarification-answered`, `clarification-stale`, `clarification-resolved`, `clarification-escalated`
     - [ ] Event payloads include: clarificationId, issueNumber, fromAgent, toAgent, topic, blocking, timestamp
     - [ ] Agent Tree provider refreshes when clarification events fire
     - [ ] Ready Queue provider shows blocked status when clarification is pending

##### Could Have (P2)

1. **Clarification Analytics**
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want to see clarification patterns over time so that I can improve agent instructions and templates
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Weekly digest includes clarification summary (total, resolved, escalated, avg rounds)
     - [ ] Most common clarification topics tracked
     - [ ] Agents with highest clarification rates identified

2. **GitHub Issue Sync (GitHub Mode Enhancement)**
   - **User Story**: As a developer using GitHub Mode, I want clarification threads mirrored to GitHub issue comments so that the full conversation is visible in GitHub
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Each clarification round posted as structured GitHub issue comment
     - [ ] Labels added/removed: `clarification:active`, `clarification:stale`
     - [ ] Escalation posts `@mention` in issue for human notification

3. **Copilot Chat `/clarify` Slash Command**
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want to check clarification status from Copilot Chat so that I don't need to switch to terminal
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `@agentx /clarify` shows active clarifications
     - [ ] `@agentx /clarify #42` shows thread for specific issue
     - [ ] Followup provider suggests clarification-related actions after relevant commands

##### Won't Have (Out of Scope)

- Direct agent-to-agent communication bypassing Agent X (breaks hub-and-spoke)
- UI buttons/panels for answering clarifications (conversation stream is the interface)
- Real-time WebSocket-based notifications (event-driven via CLI hooks is sufficient)
- Multi-party clarifications (3+ agents in one thread -- decompose into pairwise)
- Human-initiated clarification questions to agents (this is agent-to-agent only)

#### 4.2 AI/ML Requirements

##### Technology Classification
- [x] **Hybrid** - rule-based foundation with AI/ML enhancement

The clarification protocol is **rule-based orchestration** (routing, round tracking, escalation logic, file locking). The agents participating in clarifications use **LLM inference** to understand context, formulate questions, and compose answers. The detection of "ambiguity" in the agentic loop relies on LLM reasoning.

##### Model Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Model Type** | LLM (text generation -- same as existing agent model) |
| **Provider** | Any (GitHub Copilot Chat primary; Claude, OpenAI compatible) |
| **Latency** | Near-real-time (<10s per clarification round) |
| **Quality Threshold** | Clarifications must be topically relevant and actionable |
| **Cost Budget** | Each clarification round = 1 additional LLM call; max 5-6 rounds per clarification |
| **Data Sensitivity** | Same as parent issue (code context, specifications) |

##### Inference Pattern
- [x] Agent with tools (function calling / tool use) -- agents use tools to read artifacts for context
- [x] Multi-agent orchestration (sequential) -- question -> route -> answer -> resume

##### AI-Specific Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Ambiguity detection produces relevant questions (not false positives)
- [ ] Target agent answers are actionable and specific (not vague reformulations)
- [ ] Clarification context stays within token budget (compaction applied if needed)
- [ ] Graceful fallback: if LLM fails during clarification, mark as escalated

#### 4.3 Non-Functional Requirements

##### Performance
- **Clarification Round-Trip**: <15 seconds per round (question + routing + answer)
- **Lock Acquisition**: <1 second (5-second timeout max)
- **File I/O**: Clarification ledger read/write <100ms

##### Security
- **Scope Guard**: Agents can only clarify with agents listed in `can_clarify` (no arbitrary agent invocation)
- **Round Limits**: Hard cap prevents infinite loops (5 blocking, 6 non-blocking)
- **Lock Safety**: Stale lock cleanup prevents permanent deadlocks

##### Scalability
- **Concurrent Agents**: File locking supports multiple VS Code windows and CLI sessions
- **Issue Volume**: One JSON file per issue -- no single-file bottleneck
- **History**: Clarification ledger grows linearly; no cleanup needed (bounded by round limits)

##### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Lock acquisition failure -> log + retry; LLM failure -> escalate
- **Recovery**: Stale locks auto-cleaned after 30s; abandoned clarifications detected
- **Monitoring**: Event-driven checks at every workflow boundary

### 6. User Flows

#### Primary Flow: Agent Requests Blocking Clarification

**Trigger**: An agent (e.g., Engineer) encounters ambiguity in an upstream artifact (e.g., ADR)
**Preconditions**: Agent is executing a workflow step with `can_clarify` configured

**Steps**:
1. Agent detects ambiguity in upstream artifact
2. Agent creates ClarificationRequest with topic, question, and `blocking = true`
3. Agent X validates scope (`can_clarify` includes target agent)
4. Agent X acquires lock on clarification ledger, writes request, releases lock
5. Agent X sets requesting agent status to `blocked-clarification`
6. Agent X invokes target agent via `runSubagent` with full context
7. Target agent status set to `clarifying`
8. Target agent reads question + Referenced artifact, composes answer
9. Agent X acquires lock, writes answer to ledger, increments round, releases lock
10. If requesting agent needs follow-up: repeat from step 2 (round < max)
11. Agent marks clarification as `resolved`
12. Agent X resets both agents to previous status
13. Requesting agent continues with answer in context
14. **Success State**: Agent produces correct output informed by clarification

**Alternative Flows**:
- **6a. Max rounds exhausted**: After 5 rounds without resolution, Agent X sets status to `escalated`, outputs summary in chat/CLI with topic, agent positions, and recommended options. Agent work pauses until human resolves.
- **6b. Target agent fails (LLM error)**: Agent X retries once after 30s. If still fails, auto-escalate.
- **6c. Lock timeout**: Agent X retries 5 times with exponential backoff. If still fails, logs error and escalates.
- **6d. `can_clarify` scope violation**: Agent X rejects the request and logs a warning. Agent must proceed with available information.

#### Secondary Flow: Stale Clarification Detection

**Trigger**: A CLI command or lifecycle hook runs the monitoring check
**Preconditions**: Active clarification with `status = pending`

**Steps**:
1. Monitor reads all `.agentx/state/clarifications/*.json` files
2. For each `status = pending` record: compare `now` vs `staleAfter`
3. If stale: re-invoke target agent (retry 1)
4. If still stale after retry: mark `escalated`, output in next CLI/chat interaction
5. **Success State**: Stale clarification either resolved by retry or escalated for human

#### Tertiary Flow: Deadlock Detection

**Trigger**: Monitor check finds mutual blocking
**Preconditions**: Agent A has blocking clarification to Agent B AND Agent B has blocking clarification to Agent A

**Steps**:
1. Monitor detects bidirectional blocking relationship
2. Apply priority-break: upstream agent (PM > Architect > Engineer) keeps its clarification active
3. Downstream agent's clarification auto-escalated with context
4. **Success State**: Deadlock broken, one path unblocked

### 7. Dependencies & Constraints

#### Technical Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Status | Owner | Impact if Unavailable |
|------------|------|--------|-------|----------------------|
| `.agentx/state/` directory structure | Internal | Available | AgentX CLI | High - no state storage |
| `agentx-cli.ps1` (PowerShell 7+) | Internal | Available | AgentX Core | High - CLI commands blocked |
| VS Code Extension infrastructure (eventBus, channelRouter, agenticLoop) | Internal | Available | Extension | Medium - extension features blocked, CLI works |
| `runSubagent` capability (Copilot) | External | Available | GitHub Copilot | High - can't route clarification to target agent |
| Workflow TOML parser | Internal | Available | AgentX CLI | Medium - clarification config from TOML blocked |

#### Technical Constraints

- **File-based only**: No database, no external services -- must work with JSON files
- **PowerShell 7+**: CLI implementation must use PowerShell 7 (cross-platform)
- **Node.js (Extension)**: TypeScript implementation in VS Code extension
- **No background processes**: Monitoring must be event-driven (no daemon, no cron)
- **ASCII-only**: All source files use ASCII characters only (per repository rules)

#### Resource Constraints

- Implementation by AI agents following AgentX workflow
- No external infrastructure required (local-first)
- Token budget: clarification rounds add LLM calls (max 5-6 per clarification)

### 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Infinite clarification loops (A asks B, B asks A) | High | Medium | Hard round cap (5-6) + circular detection + deadlock breaking | Agent X |
| Race conditions on JSON files | High | Medium | File locking with `.lock` files + stale lock cleanup + retry | Engineer |
| Clarification adds latency to workflows | Medium | High | Only trigger for genuine ambiguity (not routine questions); non-blocking mode for suggestions | Engineer |
| Context bloat from clarification threads | Medium | Medium | Context compaction applied; clarification summary replaces full thread after resolution | Engineer |
| False positive ambiguity detection | Medium | Medium | Tune LLM prompts; only flag blocking ambiguity; allow agent to skip clarification | Architect |
| Lock files orphaned by crashed processes | Low | Medium | 30-second stale threshold auto-cleanup | Engineer |
| Scope creep (clarification becomes redesign) | Medium | Low | Answers must be 1-2 paragraphs; round limit enforces brevity; escalate for scope changes | Agent X |

---

### 10. Out of Scope

**Explicitly excluded from this Epic**:
- **Direct agent-to-agent communication** -- all routing through Agent X (hub-and-spoke preserved)
- **UI buttons/panels** for clarification actions -- conversation stream is the only interface
- **Real-time notifications** (WebSocket, push) -- event-driven at workflow boundaries is sufficient
- **Multi-party clarifications** (3+ agents in one thread) -- decompose into pairwise conversations
- **Human-initiated questions to agents** -- this is agent-to-agent only; human intervention is via issue comments or `clarify resolve`
- **Database backend** -- file-based JSON only (consistent with AgentX architecture)
- **Cross-repository clarifications** -- same repository only

**Future Considerations**:
- Clarification templates (pre-defined question patterns for common ambiguity types)
- Clarification quality scoring (was the answer actually useful?)
- Integration with GitHub Discussions for longer-form design debates
- Cross-repo clarification when AgentX supports multi-repo orchestration

---

### 11. Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| Should ambiguity detection be explicit (agent tool call) or implicit (LLM analysis)? | Architect | Open | Likely hybrid: agents can explicitly call `requestClarification` tool, and loop can detect implicit signals |
| What's the right SLA default for different agent pairs? (PM answers may take longer than Architect) | PM | Open | Start with uniform 30 min, adjust per feedback |
| Should resolved clarifications be compacted/summarized to save context tokens? | Architect | Open | Yes, post-resolution the thread should be compacted to a 1-2 sentence summary |
| How to handle clarifications during parallel UX + Architect steps? | PM | Open | Each parallel agent can independently clarify with PM; no cross-clarification between parallel agents |

## Feature PRD: Persistent Agent Memory Pipeline

> Originally PRD-29.md | Epic #29 | Priority: p1 | Status: Draft | Date: 2026-02-27


### 1. Problem Statement

#### What problem are we solving?

AgentX's `ContextCompactor` currently provides in-session token budget tracking, regex-based conversation summarization, and a progress-log compaction utility. However, it has **no persistent storage layer** -- every piece of agent knowledge (decisions, code changes, errors, learnings) is lost the moment a session ends.  When a new session starts, agents rebuild context from scratch by re-reading files, re-parsing history, and re-discovering patterns they already identified.

The compaction logic itself is also limited: it uses deterministic regex extraction (decision keywords, file-change patterns, error patterns) rather than a layered retrieval strategy. There is no way to **search** past sessions, no **progressive disclosure** to control token cost, and no **automatic capture/injection pipeline** that feeds observations in and recalls relevant ones later.

#### Why is this important?

- **Session continuity**: Multi-session features (Epics spanning days/weeks) lose cumulative context at each session boundary. Engineers re-discover the same patterns, Architects forget prior trade-off discussions, Reviewers lose context on previous review rounds.
- **Token efficiency**: Re-loading the same skills, instructions, and PRDs every session wastes 30-60% of the context window on static priming content that could be summarized from memory.
- **Quality**: Agents that remember past decisions, errors, and learnings produce fewer regressions and more consistent outputs.
- **Competitive parity**: Leading agent memory systems demonstrate that persistent capture + compression + retrieval yields measurably better context utilization and agent output quality.

#### What happens if we don't solve this?

Agent sessions remain stateless. Every session is a cold start. Knowledge compounds only in external documents (PRD, ADR, specs), not in the agent runtime itself. As project complexity grows, the compaction module stays useful only for intra-session budget monitoring, not for cross-session intelligence.

---

### 2. Target Users

#### Primary Users

**User Persona 1: AgentX Developer (Observer/Operator)**
- **Goals**: Have agents retain knowledge across sessions; reduce manual context re-priming; search past agent activity.
- **Pain Points**: Must re-explain context every session; cannot query what agents did in past sessions; budget reports are ephemeral.
- **Behaviors**: Uses `@agentx` in Copilot Chat; monitors agent activity via sidebar tree views and context budget command; runs multi-session workflows on large features.

**User Persona 2: AgentX Agents (Consumers)**
- **Goals**: Automatically receive relevant past observations at session start; avoid re-discovering known patterns; maintain decision continuity.
- **Pain Points**: No recall mechanism beyond reading static documents; `compactConversation()` output is not saved or reusable; no way to query "what did I learn in the last session about this file?"
- **Behaviors**: Follow workflow TOML steps; read upstream deliverables; produce downstream deliverables; currently rely solely on in-session `ContextCompactor` for budget awareness.

#### Secondary Users

- **Team Leads / Project Managers**: Benefit from a searchable log of agent activity across sessions to audit agent behavior and measure productivity.
- **Plugin Authors**: Could build on a memory API to persist plugin-specific state across sessions.

---

### 3. Goals & Success Metrics

#### Business Goals

1. **Cross-session knowledge retention**: Agents recall decisions, errors, and learnings from previous sessions without manual re-priming.
2. **Token efficiency**: Reduce redundant context loading by 40%+ through memory-informed priming instead of full document re-reads.
3. **Searchable agent history**: Users can query past agent observations using natural language or keyword search.

#### Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Cross-session recall accuracy | 0% (no persistence) | >=80% of relevant prior decisions surfaced | Phase 2 |
| Context priming token savings | 0% (full re-read) | >=40% reduction in priming tokens | Phase 2 |
| Observation search latency (p95) | N/A | <200ms for 10K observations | Phase 1 |
| Session start context injection | Manual (re-read docs) | Automatic (top-k relevant facts) | Phase 2 |
| Agent rework rate on multi-session features | Baseline TBD | >=25% reduction | Phase 3 |

#### User Success Criteria

- A new session on the same project starts with a concise summary of what happened last time.
- Running a search command returns relevant past observations with source, date, and category.
- The context budget report distinguishes between "fresh" and "recalled from memory" items.

---

### 4. Requirements

#### 4.1 Functional Requirements

##### Must Have (P0)

1. **Observation Capture**: Automatically capture agent observations (decisions, code changes, errors, key facts) at session end.
   - **User Story**: As an agent operator, I want agent observations automatically saved when a session ends so that knowledge is not lost.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `compactConversation()` output is persisted to disk after each session
     - [ ] Each observation record includes: source agent, issue number, category, timestamp, content, estimated tokens
     - [ ] Observations stored in a structured format (JSON or SQLite)

2. **Observation Store**: Provide a local, file-based persistence layer for observations.
   - **User Story**: As an agent operator, I want a local store of all agent observations so that they survive session restarts.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Store supports create, read, list, and search operations
     - [ ] Observations are indexed by agent, issue, category, and date
     - [ ] Store is located at `.agentx/memory/` within the workspace
     - [ ] Full-text search over observation content returns results in <200ms for 10K records

3. **Session-Start Injection**: Automatically inject relevant past observations at the start of a new session.
   - **User Story**: As an agent, I want to receive a summary of relevant past observations when my session starts so that I have continuity without re-reading everything.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] On session start, the top-k most relevant observations for the current issue/agent are retrieved
     - [ ] Retrieved observations are tracked as `memory` category in `ContextCompactor`
     - [ ] Total injected memory respects a configurable token budget (default: 10% of context limit)
     - [ ] Injected context is formatted as a "Memory Recall" section prepended to the session

##### Should Have (P1)

4. **Progressive Disclosure Search**: Enable layered retrieval -- compact index first, full detail on demand.
   - **User Story**: As an agent operator, I want to search memory starting with a compact index, then drill into details, so that I control token cost.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `searchMemory(query, limit)` returns compact index entries (~50 tokens each)
     - [ ] `getObservation(id)` returns full detail for a specific observation
     - [ ] VS Code command "AgentX: Search Memory" exposes this to users

5. **Lifecycle Hook Integration**: Wire capture and injection into AgentX lifecycle hooks.
   - **User Story**: As an agent framework, I want memory capture/injection to happen automatically via lifecycle hooks so that no manual step is needed.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `hook -Phase finish` triggers observation capture for the completing agent
     - [ ] `hook -Phase start` triggers memory injection for the starting agent
     - [ ] Event bus emits `memory-recalled` event with token cost details

6. **Memory Budget Reporting**: Extend the context budget report to include memory usage.
   - **User Story**: As an agent operator, I want the context budget to show how much memory is being used for recalled observations so that I can tune the memory budget.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `formatBudgetReport()` includes a "Memory" section showing recalled items
     - [ ] Budget status accounts for memory tokens in threshold calculations

##### Could Have (P2)

7. **Memory Decay / Relevance Scoring**: Weight observations by recency, frequency of recall, and context similarity.
   - **User Story**: As an agent, I want older or less relevant observations to be deprioritized so that my context window is filled with the most useful memories.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Observations have a `relevanceScore` computed from recency, recall count, and keyword overlap
     - [ ] Injection selects by highest relevance score within the token budget

8. **Memory Compaction (Summarization)**: Periodically summarize clusters of related observations into higher-level summaries.
   - **User Story**: As an agent operator, I want the memory store to self-compact over time so that it stays fast and token-efficient.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] A compaction pass can merge N related observations into 1 summary
     - [ ] Original observations are archived, not deleted
     - [ ] Compaction runs on-demand via a VS Code command or CLI subcommand

##### Won't Have (Out of Scope)

- **Vector/embedding-based semantic search**: Deferred to future phase -- start with FTS.
- **Multi-project / cross-repo memory sharing**: Each workspace has its own memory store.
- **Cloud-hosted memory sync**: Memory lives on-disk only; no remote storage.
- **Real-time web viewer UI**: No HTTP server for memory browsing (use VS Code commands).

#### 4.2 AI/ML Requirements

##### Technology Classification

- [x] **Rule-based / statistical** - no model needed (deterministic logic only)

> Rationale: Phase 1-2 use regex extraction (existing), full-text search (FTS5 or lunr.js), and recency-based scoring. No LLM inference is required for the memory pipeline itself. The existing `compactConversation()` regex extractors serve as the observation producer. If future phases introduce embedding-based retrieval, this classification will be updated to Hybrid.

#### 4.3 Non-Functional Requirements

##### Performance

- **Observation Write Latency**: <50ms per observation (append to store)
- **Search Latency (p95)**: <200ms for full-text search over 10K observations
- **Session Start Overhead**: <500ms for memory injection (retrieve + format)

##### Security

- **Data at Rest**: Observations stored as plaintext JSON/SQLite on local disk (same security posture as `.agentx/` directory)
- **Privacy Tags**: Support `<private>` markers in conversation content to exclude from memory capture (consistent with existing session behavior)
- **No Secrets**: Memory capture MUST strip API keys, tokens, and credentials using the existing SecurityHelpers module

##### Scalability

- **Observation Volume**: Support up to 50K observations per workspace without degradation
- **Store Size**: Target <50MB for 50K observations (avg ~200 words each)

##### Reliability

- **Crash Safety**: Use atomic writes (write-to-temp, rename) to prevent store corruption
- **Graceful Degradation**: If memory store is unavailable or corrupt, session starts normally without memory injection (log warning, never block)

### 6. User Flows

#### Primary Flow: Automatic Memory Capture & Recall

**Trigger**: Agent session lifecycle (start / finish hooks)
**Preconditions**: AgentX initialized in workspace; `.agentx/memory/` directory exists.

**Steps**:
1. Agent finishes session via `hook -Phase finish`
2. System runs `compactConversation()` on the session messages (existing logic)
3. System persists the compacted observations to `.agentx/memory/` store with metadata (agent, issue, category, timestamp)
4. Event bus emits `memory-stored` event
5. --- (session boundary) ---
6. New session starts via `hook -Phase start`
7. System queries memory store for top-k observations relevant to the current issue and agent
8. System formats results as a "Memory Recall" section, staying within the memory token budget
9. System injects the recall section into the session context
10. System tracks injected items as `memory` category in `ContextCompactor`
11. **Success State**: Agent begins work with prior context already loaded

**Alternative Flows**:
- **6a. Empty memory**: No prior observations exist -- session starts normally, no recall section injected.
- **6b. Corrupt store**: Store file is malformed -- system logs a warning, skips injection, and continues.
- **6c. Budget exceeded**: Recalled observations exceed memory token budget -- system truncates to highest-relevance items within budget.

#### Secondary Flow: Manual Memory Search

**Trigger**: User runs "AgentX: Search Memory" command
**Preconditions**: Memory store exists with observations.

**Steps**:
1. User invokes command from VS Code Command Palette
2. System prompts for search query (text input)
3. System runs full-text search on memory store
4. System displays compact index results in output channel (ID, agent, date, summary)
5. User can copy an ID and use "AgentX: Get Observation" for full detail
6. **Success State**: User finds relevant past observation

### 7. Dependencies & Constraints

#### Technical Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Status | Owner | Impact if Unavailable |
|------------|------|--------|-------|----------------------|
| `ContextCompactor` | Internal | Available (v6.1) | AgentX | High - Memory capture depends on compaction output |
| `AgentEventBus` | Internal | Available (v6.1) | AgentX | Medium - Events are informational, not blocking |
| AgentX Lifecycle Hooks | Internal | Available (v4.0) | AgentX | High - Automatic capture/injection requires hooks |
| Per-issue JSON file store | Internal (new) | To Build | AgentX | High - Core persistence layer (decided in [ADR-29](../adr/ADR-AgentX.md)) |

#### Technical Constraints

- Must use local file storage only (no external database server)
- Must not require additional runtime dependencies beyond Node.js (built-in `fs` + JSON only per [ADR-29](../adr/ADR-AgentX.md))
- Must integrate with existing `ContextCompactor` API -- extend, do not replace
- Must work in both `github` and `local` modes
- Memory store format must be human-readable or inspectable (no opaque binary blobs)

#### Resource Constraints

- Development: 1-2 engineers over 3 phases
- Timeline: 6 weeks total (2 weeks per phase)
- No cloud infrastructure budget (all local)

### 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Memory store grows unbounded on large projects | Medium | Medium | Implement P2 compaction + configurable max size with LRU eviction | Engineer |
| Regex-based extraction misses important observations | Medium | High | **Phase 1 gate**: Run extractor against 3+ real past sessions and manually inspect captured observations before proceeding to Phase 2 injection. Track recall accuracy; plan hybrid extraction if quality insufficient. | Architect |
| Session start latency increases with large memory stores | High | Low | Index-first architecture; lazy loading; performance benchmarks in CI | Engineer |
| Store corruption loses all memory | High | Low | Atomic writes; periodic backup; graceful degradation on read failure | Engineer |
| Scope creep into embedding/vector search | Medium | Medium | Explicitly out of scope for v1; revisit after FTS baseline established | PM |

---

### 10. Out of Scope

**Explicitly excluded from this Epic**:

- **Vector/embedding-based semantic search** - Deferred. Start with full-text search to establish baseline. Evaluate after Phase 3 based on recall accuracy metrics.
- **Cross-workspace memory sharing** - Each workspace has its own isolated memory store.
- **Cloud-hosted memory sync** - No remote storage, sync, or backup service.
- **Web viewer UI for memory** - Use VS Code output channels and commands only.
- **LLM-powered summarization for compaction** - Phase 1-2 use existing regex extraction. LLM summarization is a future enhancement.
- **Memory for non-AgentX workflows** - Only agent lifecycle sessions are captured.

**Future Considerations**:

- Embedding index (ChromaDB or similar) for semantic retrieval in Phase 4+
- Memory sharing across workspaces for monorepo setups
- Export/import of memory snapshots for team sharing

---

### 11. Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| JSON file vs SQLite for v1 store? | Architect | **Resolved** | Per-issue JSON files with in-memory manifest index. Zero new dependencies, pattern-consistent with ADR-1. See [ADR-29](../adr/ADR-AgentX.md#decision-1-storage-layout). |
| Should memory injection be opt-in or opt-out? | PM | **Resolved** | Opt-out (enabled by default with `agentx.memory.enabled` setting). |
| What is the right default memory token budget? | PM | **Resolved** | 10% of context limit (20K tokens for 200K context). Configurable via `agentx.memory.maxTokens`. |
| Should `<private>` tags in conversation exclude content from memory? | PM | **Resolved** | Yes -- consistent with existing session privacy behavior. SecurityHelpers module strips sensitive content. |

---

### 12. Appendix

#### Research Context

A competitive analysis of leading persistent agent memory systems identified five key architectural patterns that AgentX's current `ContextCompactor` lacks:

1. **Persistent observation store** - Sessions capture tool usage, decisions, errors to a local database (SQLite). AgentX: currently in-memory only.
2. **Lifecycle hook capture pipeline** - Observations are captured automatically at session boundaries via hooks. AgentX: hooks exist but are not wired to memory.
3. **Progressive disclosure retrieval** - 3-layer search (compact index -> timeline -> full detail) saves ~10x tokens vs fetching everything. AgentX: single-summary output only.
4. **Automatic session-start injection** - Relevant observations are auto-injected into new sessions. AgentX: no injection mechanism.
5. **Token-cost-aware retrieval** - Each retrieval layer exposes token cost; budgets are enforced. AgentX: budget tracking exists but is disconnected from retrieval.

The analysis confirmed that a rule-based approach (FTS + recency scoring) is sufficient for v1, with embedding-based search as a future enhancement.

#### Glossary

- **Observation**: A captured unit of agent knowledge (decision, code change, error, key fact) extracted from a conversation session.
- **Memory Store**: The persistent storage layer for observations.
- **Memory Injection**: The process of retrieving and formatting relevant past observations for inclusion in a new session's context.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: A retrieval pattern where compact summaries are shown first; full details are fetched only for selected items.
- **Relevance Score**: A numeric weight combining recency, recall frequency, and keyword overlap to rank observations.

## Feature PRD: Agentic Loop Quality Framework

> Epic #30 | Priority: p1 | Status: Completed | Date: 2026-03-05

### 1. Problem Statement

#### What problem are we solving?

AgentX's agentic loop (`agenticLoop.ts`) lacked built-in quality assurance mechanisms. When agents completed work, there was no automated review step -- output went directly to the next phase. Similarly, when an agent encountered ambiguity in an upstream artifact, there was no lightweight mechanism to resolve it without human intervention.

The previously planned Clarification Protocol (Feature PRD #1, ADR-1) specified a heavy file-based system with JSON ledgers, file locking, TOML extensions, and event-driven monitoring. While comprehensive, this approach was over-engineered for the most common use case: a quick iterative Q&A between two agents within a single session.

#### Why is this important?

- **Quality**: Agents that self-review catch bugs, missing tests, and docs gaps before handoff -- reducing rework cycles by the Reviewer agent.
- **Autonomy**: Inter-agent clarification lets agents resolve ambiguity without pausing the pipeline for human input.
- **Universality**: The self-review pattern works for ALL agent roles (PM, Architect, Engineer, Tester, etc.), not just code-producing agents.
- **Simplicity**: A lightweight, LLM-based approach is faster to implement, easier to test, and sufficient for in-session clarification.

#### What happens if we don't solve this?

Agents produce output without self-checking, leading to review cycles. Ambiguity causes agents to guess or stall. The gap between "agent-generated" and "handoff-ready" remains wide.

### 2. Target Users

**Primary**: All AgentX agents (PM, Architect, Engineer, Reviewer, Tester, Data Scientist, DevOps)
**Secondary**: AgentX developers who extend or customize the agentic loop

|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Self-review coverage | 0% (no automated review) | 100% of agent outputs reviewed before handoff | [PASS] Achieved |
| Reviewer rejection rate | Baseline TBD | >=30% reduction via self-review | [PASS] Implemented |
| Clarification resolution (in-session) | 0% (manual only) | >=80% resolved without human | [PASS] Implemented |
| Human escalation rate | 100% (all ambiguity requires human) | <20% escalation rate | [PASS] Implemented |

### 7. Relationship to Planned Clarification Protocol (Feature PRD #1)

The Clarification Protocol Feature PRD describes a comprehensive file-based system with:
- JSON clarification ledgers per issue
- File locking (FileLockManager)
- TOML `can_clarify` workflow fields
- EventBus events for clarification lifecycle
- Stale/stuck/deadlock monitoring
- CLI `clarify` subcommand
- GitHub issue comment mirroring

**What was actually built** is a lightweight alternative focused on **in-session, LLM-based clarification**:
- No file-based ledgers (clarification happens in-memory during the agentic loop)
- No file locking needed (no cross-process state)
- No TOML extensions (configuration via `ClarificationLoopConfig`)
- No monitoring daemon (bounded by max iterations with human fallback)
- Works immediately in both Chat and CLI modes

The heavy file-based protocol remains a future option for **cross-session, cross-process clarification** scenarios (e.g., when PM and Architect agents run in separate sessions). The lightweight loop handles the common case of in-session clarification.

## Feature PRD: Security Hardening and Agentic Loop Enhancements

> Originally PRD-47.md | Epic #47 | Priority: p0 | Status: Completed | Date: 2026-03-03

### 1. Problem Statement

#### What problem are we solving?

AgentX's agentic loop grants LLM-driven agents the ability to execute shell commands, read/write files, and interact with external services. The current security model relies on a short denylist of dangerous commands (4 entries in toolEngine.ts) and lacks depth-in-defense measures such as path sandboxing, secret redaction, SSRF protection, and structured audit logging. Additionally, the agentic loop executes tool calls sequentially, provides no progress tracking or stall detection, and has limited resilience to transient LLM failures. These gaps prevent AgentX from meeting production-grade security and reliability standards expected by enterprise engineering teams.

#### Why is this important?

- **Security**: A denylist approach is trivially bypassed (e.g., encoding, aliasing, compound commands). Production-grade agentic systems require allowlist validation, path sandboxing, secret redaction, and SSRF protection as defense-in-depth layers.
- **Reliability**: Without retry logic, stall detection, or structured progress tracking, the agentic loop can silently fail, spin indefinitely, or lose context on transient errors.
- **Auditability**: Enterprise teams need structured JSON logs with correlation IDs, file rotation, and timing data for compliance and incident investigation.
- **Performance**: Sequential tool execution wastes time when the LLM returns multiple independent tool calls that could run concurrently.

#### What happens if we don't solve this?

- Agents can be tricked into executing dangerous commands via prompt injection or indirect attacks that evade the trivial denylist.
- Secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials) may leak into logs visible to users or stored on disk.
- The agentic loop hangs on transient LLM outages with no recovery path.
- Enterprise adoption is blocked due to insufficient security posture and lack of audit trails.
- Developer trust erodes when agents appear "stuck" with no visibility into progress.

- **Pain Points**: Concerned that AI agents might delete files, expose credentials, or get stuck in infinite loops
- **Behaviors**: Uses default configurations; relies on sensible defaults for security; wants clear feedback when something goes wrong

#### Secondary Users

- **DevOps engineers** who need structured logs for monitoring and alerting pipelines
- **Security auditors** who evaluate the tool's command execution and data handling practices
- **Open-source contributors** who extend AgentX with custom tools and need clear security integration patterns

### 3. Goals & Success Metrics

#### Business Goals

1. **Security Posture**: Elevate command execution security from a 4-entry denylist to a comprehensive allowlist + sandboxing + redaction defense-in-depth model
2. **Reliability**: Achieve zero silent failures in the agentic loop through retry logic, stall detection, and structured progress tracking
3. **Enterprise Readiness**: Provide structured logging with JSON output and file rotation that integrates with standard monitoring/SIEM tools
4. **Performance**: Reduce agentic loop latency by executing independent tool calls in parallel

#### Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Blocked dangerous command patterns | 4 denylist entries | Allowlist with compound analysis | Phase 1 |
| Secret patterns detected in logs | 0 (no redaction) | 100% of known patterns redacted | Phase 1 |
| Path traversal attacks blocked | 0 (no sandboxing) | All sensitive paths blocked | Phase 2 |
| Tool execution throughput (parallel) | 1x (sequential) | Up to Nx for N independent calls | Phase 2 |
| Stall detection and recovery | None | Auto-replan after 3 stalls | Phase 2 |
| Structured log coverage | 0% | 100% of agentic events | Phase 2 |
| LLM retry success on transient errors | 0% (crash) | 90%+ recovery | Phase 2 |
| Unit test coverage on new modules | N/A | >= 80% | All Phases |

#### User Success Criteria

- An agent attempting to run an unknown command is prompted for confirmation with a reversibility classification (easy/effort/irreversible) and undo hint
- API keys and tokens never appear in user-visible log output or persisted log files
- The agentic loop automatically retries on transient LLM failures and replans when stalled
- Enterprise users can point their SIEM at JSON log files with correlation IDs for full audit trails
- Parallel tool execution is transparent to agents -- no behavioral changes, only faster completion

---

### 4. Requirements

#### 4.1 Functional Requirements

##### Must Have (P0)

1. **Allowlist-based Command Security**
   - Replace the current denylist in toolEngine.ts (line ~299) with an allowlist-based validation system
   - Only commands matching the allowlist auto-execute; all unknown commands require user confirmation
   - Parse compound commands (splitting on `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`) and validate each sub-command independently
   - Maintain a configurable allowlist that users can extend via VS Code settings
   - **User Story**: As an enterprise team lead, I want only known-safe commands to auto-execute so that prompt injection or accidental dangerous commands are blocked by default
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Allowlist loaded from configuration at engine initialization
     - [ ] Compound commands split and each sub-command validated independently
     - [ ] Unknown commands trigger confirmation dialog with command details
     - [ ] Allowlist is extensible via `agentx.security.commandAllowlist` VS Code setting
     - [ ] All 4 existing denylist patterns remain blocked (defense in depth)
     - [ ] Unit tests cover: allowlisted command passes, unknown command prompts, compound splitting, denylist override

2. **Secret Redaction in Logs**
   - Create a `secretRedactor.ts` utility that strips known credential patterns from any string
   - Patterns: Bearer tokens, `sk-*`, `ghp_*`, `gho_*`, `github_pat_*`, AWS access keys (`AKIA*`), Azure connection strings, generic `password=`, `secret=`, `token=`, and base64-encoded JWT segments
   - Integrate with ThinkingLog and any future structured logger
   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want my API keys and tokens automatically stripped from log output so that credentials are never exposed in visible panels or log files
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Regex-based redaction covers all listed patterns
     - [ ] Replacement text is `[REDACTED]` with pattern type hint (e.g., `[REDACTED:bearer]`)
     - [ ] Redactor is idempotent (double-redaction produces same output)
     - [ ] Integrated with ThinkingLog output before display/persistence
     - [ ] Unit tests with sample strings containing each credential pattern
     - [ ] No false positives on common English words or code identifiers

3. **Action Reversibility Classification**
   - When a command requires confirmation (not in allowlist), classify its reversibility
   - Categories: `easy` (undo available, e.g., git stash, git checkout), `effort` (manual restore needed, e.g., file overwrite with no backup), `irreversible` (cannot undo, e.g., rm -rf, DROP TABLE)
   - Display the classification and undo hint in the confirmation dialog
   - **User Story**: As a solo developer, I want to see how risky a command is and how to undo it before I approve it so that I make informed decisions about agent actions
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Classification engine maps command patterns to reversibility categories
     - [ ] `easy` commands show specific undo hint (e.g., "Undo: git stash pop")
     - [ ] `effort` commands show warning and general recovery guidance
     - [ ] `irreversible` commands show strong warning with red indicator
     - [ ] Classification displayed in VS Code confirmation dialog
     - [ ] Classification logic is extensible (new patterns can be added)
     - [ ] Unit tests cover all three categories with representative commands

##### Should Have (P1)

4. **Dual-Ledger Progress Tracking**
   - Implement `TaskLedger` (objective, facts, assumptions, plan) and `ProgressLedger` (current step index, step history, stall count, last progress timestamp)
   - Stall detection: 3 consecutive failed steps trigger replan (regenerate plan from TaskLedger)
   - Time-based stale detection: 60 seconds without progress update triggers a warning event
   - Expose ledger state via ThinkingLog events for UI visibility
   - **User Story**: As an agent developer, I want to see what step the agent is on and whether it is making progress so that I can intervene early if something goes wrong
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] TaskLedger stores objective, facts[], assumptions[], plan[]
     - [ ] ProgressLedger tracks currentStep, stepHistory[], stallCount, lastProgressTimestamp
     - [ ] After 3 consecutive failures, loop triggers replan using TaskLedger context
     - [ ] After 60s without progress, a stale warning event is emitted
     - [ ] Ledger state visible in ThinkingLog output
     - [ ] Unit tests for stall detection, replan trigger, and stale timeout

5. **Parallel Tool Execution**
   - When the LLM returns multiple tool calls in a single response, identify independent calls (no data dependencies)
   - Execute independent calls via `Promise.allSettled()` instead of sequential awaits
   - Collect results in original order and append to conversation
   - Fall back to sequential execution if any call depends on a previous call's output
   - **User Story**: As an agent developer, I want independent tool calls to execute in parallel so that multi-tool responses complete faster
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Multiple tool calls in a single LLM response execute concurrently when independent
     - [ ] Results are collected in original order regardless of completion order
     - [ ] `Promise.allSettled()` used so one failure does not cancel others
     - [ ] Sequential fallback when dependency detected
     - [ ] Performance improvement measurable (log elapsed time for parallel vs. sequential)
     - [ ] Unit tests with mock tools verifying parallel execution and result ordering

6. **Path Sandboxing**
   - Extend toolEngine.ts to validate file paths before read/write/execute operations
   - Block access to sensitive directories: `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, `.gnupg/`, `.azure/`, `.kube/`
   - Block access to sensitive file patterns: `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*password*`, `*secret*`, `*.pfx`, `*.p12`
   - Configurable workspace-root-relative sandbox boundary
   - **User Story**: As an enterprise team lead, I want file access restricted to the workspace and away from credential stores so that agents cannot exfiltrate sensitive files
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Path validation runs before any file read/write/execute tool
     - [ ] Blocked directory list is configurable via `agentx.security.blockedPaths` setting
     - [ ] Blocked file patterns configurable via `agentx.security.blockedFilePatterns` setting
     - [ ] Path traversal attempts (e.g., `../../.ssh/id_rsa`) detected and blocked
     - [ ] Clear error message returned to the LLM explaining why access was denied
     - [ ] Unit tests for directory blocking, pattern blocking, traversal detection

7. **LLM Retry with Exponential Backoff**
   - Add retry logic to the LlmAdapter layer (vscodeLmAdapter.ts) for transient failures
   - Retry on: HTTP 429 (rate limit), 500/502/503 (server errors), network timeouts
   - Exponential backoff: base 1s, multiplier 2x, max 32s, jitter +/- 20%
   - Maximum 5 retries before propagating the error
   - **User Story**: As an agent developer, I want the agentic loop to automatically retry on transient LLM errors so that temporary outages do not crash the entire workflow
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Retry logic wraps LLM API calls in the adapter layer
     - [ ] Retries on 429, 500, 502, 503, and network timeout errors
     - [ ] Exponential backoff with jitter (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s cap)
     - [ ] Maximum 5 retries before throwing
     - [ ] Retry attempts logged with attempt number, delay, and error type
     - [ ] Non-transient errors (400, 401, 403) are NOT retried
     - [ ] Unit tests for retry count, backoff timing, jitter range, non-retriable errors

8. **Structured Logging with File Rotation**
   - Create a `structuredLogger.ts` utility with JSON-formatted log entries
   - Fields: timestamp (ISO 8601), level (debug/info/warn/error), correlationId, agentName, toolName, message, durationMs, metadata
   - File rotation: 10 MB max per file, 5 rotated files kept
   - Output to `.agentx/logs/` directory
   - Integrate secret redaction (from P0 feature) on all log entries
   - **User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want JSON-structured log files with rotation so that I can integrate AgentX logs into our monitoring and alerting pipeline
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Log entries are valid JSON with all specified fields
     - [ ] Correlation ID propagated across related log entries within a loop iteration
     - [ ] File rotation at 10 MB boundary with 5 file retention
     - [ ] Logs written to `.agentx/logs/agentx-{date}.json`
     - [ ] Secret redaction applied to all log entry string fields
     - [ ] Performance timing utility (`time()` wrapper) integrated
     - [ ] Unit tests for JSON format, rotation trigger, correlation ID propagation

##### Could Have (P2)

9. **OnError Hook with Retry/Fallback**
   - Add `onError` to the `AgenticLoopHooks` interface alongside existing `onToolCall`, `onMessage` hooks
   - Hook receives error context (tool name, error, attempt count) and returns a strategy: `retry`, `fallback` (with replacement result), or `abort`
   - Default behavior (no hook registered): abort on error (current behavior preserved)
   - **User Story**: As an agent developer, I want to register error handlers that can retry or provide fallback results so that non-critical tool failures do not crash the loop
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] `onError` hook added to AgenticLoopHooks interface
     - [ ] Hook receives { toolName, error, attemptCount, context }
     - [ ] Hook can return { strategy: 'retry' | 'fallback' | 'abort', fallbackResult? }
     - [ ] Default behavior is abort (backward compatible)
     - [ ] Maximum 3 retries per tool call via onError
     - [ ] Unit tests for retry, fallback, and abort strategies

10. **Codebase Analysis Tools**
    - `analyze_codebase`: File counts by extension, lines of code, technology stack detection (package.json, requirements.txt, *.csproj), repo size
    - `find_dependencies`: Parse package.json/requirements.txt/*.csproj and list direct dependencies with versions
    - `map_architecture`: Identify entry points, config files, test directories, CI/CD files, and output a structural summary
    - **User Story**: As an AI agent, I want tools to understand the codebase structure and dependencies so that I can make informed decisions about implementations
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:
      - [ ] `analyze_codebase` returns file counts, LOC, detected technologies
      - [ ] `find_dependencies` parses at least 3 package formats
      - [ ] `map_architecture` identifies entry points, configs, tests, CI files
      - [ ] All tools registered in ToolRegistry with proper schemas
      - [ ] Results are structured (JSON-formatted ToolResult)
      - [ ] Unit tests with mock project structures

11. **SSRF Protection**
    - Validate URLs before any HTTP request tool execution
    - Block private IP ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 127.0.0.0/8
    - Block cloud metadata endpoints: 169.254.169.254, fd00::/8
    - Block `file://` protocol and other non-HTTP(S) schemes
    - DNS resolution check to catch DNS rebinding (resolve before request, validate IP)
    - **User Story**: As an enterprise team lead, I want outbound HTTP requests validated against SSRF attacks so that agents cannot be tricked into accessing internal infrastructure
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:
      - [ ] Private IP ranges blocked with clear error message
      - [ ] Cloud metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) blocked
      - [ ] file://, ftp://, gopher:// schemes blocked
      - [ ] DNS resolution performed before request, resolved IP validated
      - [ ] Configurable allowlist for internal URLs that should be permitted
      - [ ] Unit tests for each blocked range, scheme, and DNS rebinding scenario

12. **Parallel Agent Executor**
    - Enable multiple sub-agents to run concurrently from subAgentSpawner.ts
    - Strategies: `all` (wait for all, merge results), `race` (first success wins), `quorum` (majority must agree)
    - Consolidation methods: `merge` (combine all outputs), `vote` (majority answer), `best` (highest confidence)
    - Timeout per sub-agent with graceful cancellation
    - **User Story**: As an agent developer, I want to run multiple sub-agents in parallel with configurable strategies so that complex tasks can be decomposed and executed concurrently
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:
      - [ ] `runParallel()` method added to SubAgentSpawner
      - [ ] Supports all, race, and quorum strategies
      - [ ] Supports merge, vote, and best consolidation methods
      - [ ] Per-agent timeout with cancellation token
      - [ ] Results consolidated according to selected method
      - [ ] Unit tests for each strategy and consolidation combination

13. **Persistent Cross-Session Memory**
    - Create a lightweight memory store using JSON/JSONL files in `.agentx/memory/`
    - Operations: store(key, value, tags[]), recall(query), forget(key)
    - Tag-based recall for filtering observations
    - Automatic expiry: entries older than configurable TTL (default 30 days) are pruned on load
    - **User Story**: As an AI agent, I want to remember facts and observations across sessions so that I do not repeat analysis or lose context between conversations
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:
      - [ ] Memory stored in `.agentx/memory/observations.jsonl`
      - [ ] store(), recall(), forget() operations functional
      - [ ] Tag-based filtering on recall
      - [ ] TTL-based automatic pruning
      - [ ] File locking for concurrent access safety
      - [ ] Unit tests for CRUD operations, tag filtering, and TTL expiry

##### Won't Have (Out of Scope)

- GUI-based security policy editor (future epic)
- Custom LLM provider plugin system (existing adapter is sufficient)
- Real-time collaborative multi-user agent sessions
- Cloud-hosted log aggregation service (users integrate with their own SIEM)

#### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

##### Performance

- **Parallel Tool Execution**: Independent tool calls must execute concurrently with no serialization overhead
- **Retry Latency**: Exponential backoff must not exceed 32 seconds per retry; total retry sequence under 2 minutes
- **Logging Throughput**: Structured logger must handle 1000+ log entries per second without blocking the agentic loop
- **Secret Redaction**: Redaction must complete in under 1ms per log entry (regex pre-compiled)

##### Security

- **Defense in Depth**: Allowlist + denylist + path sandboxing + secret redaction + SSRF protection as layered defenses
- **Least Privilege**: Commands not in the allowlist require explicit user approval
- **No Secret Persistence**: Redacted secrets must never be written to disk in any form
- **Path Isolation**: Workspace sandbox prevents access to credential stores outside the project

##### Scalability

- **Log Rotation**: 10 MB per file x 5 files = 50 MB maximum disk usage for logs
- **Memory Store**: JSONL format supports append-only writes for efficient large stores
- **Parallel Agents**: Sub-agent executor supports up to 10 concurrent agents

##### Reliability

- **LLM Retry**: 5 retries with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Stall Detection**: 3 consecutive failures trigger automatic replanning
- **Stale Detection**: 60-second timeout emits warning event for monitoring
- **Graceful Degradation**: If structured logger fails, fall back to console output

### 6. User Flows

#### Primary Flow: Allowlist Command Validation

**Trigger**: LLM returns a tool call requesting shell command execution
**Preconditions**: Agentic loop is running; toolEngine.ts processes the tool call

**Steps**:
1. LLM returns a `run_command` tool call with a shell command string
2. Tool engine checks the command against the hard-coded denylist (existing defense layer)
3. If denylist match -> block immediately with error message (no change from current behavior)
4. Tool engine splits compound commands on `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`
5. Each sub-command is checked against the allowlist
6. If ALL sub-commands are allowlisted -> execute immediately (auto-approve)
7. If ANY sub-command is NOT allowlisted -> classify reversibility (easy/effort/irreversible)
8. Show confirmation dialog with: command text, reversibility classification, undo hint
9. User approves -> execute command; User denies -> return denial to LLM
10. **Success State**: Command executes safely or user makes informed denial

**Alternative Flows**:
- **5a. Empty command**: Return error "Empty command" to LLM
- **8a. Irreversible command**: Confirmation dialog uses red warning indicator and requires explicit "I understand" checkbox
- **9a. Timeout (30s no response)**: Auto-deny and return timeout to LLM

#### Secondary Flow: Stall Detection and Replan

**Trigger**: Agentic loop detects 3 consecutive tool call failures
**Preconditions**: Dual-ledger progress tracking is active; TaskLedger has a valid plan

**Steps**:
1. Tool call fails; ProgressLedger increments stallCount
2. stallCount reaches 3
3. Loop pauses tool execution
4. TaskLedger's current plan is sent back to LLM with context: "Plan stalled after 3 consecutive failures. Facts: [...], Last 3 errors: [...]. Please revise the plan."
5. LLM returns a revised plan
6. TaskLedger updated with new plan; ProgressLedger reset (stallCount = 0, new steps)
7. Loop resumes with revised plan
8. **Success State**: Agent recovers from stall and continues making progress

**Alternative Flows**:
- **5a. LLM fails during replan**: Retry with exponential backoff (P1 feature)
- **7a. Second stall (stallCount = 3 again after replan)**: Emit critical warning event; if configured, abort loop with summary of attempts

#### Tertiary Flow: Secret Redaction in Logging Pipeline

**Trigger**: Any component writes a log entry or displays output in ThinkingLog
**Preconditions**: secretRedactor.ts is initialized

**Steps**:
1. Component generates a log message string
2. Before writing to output, the string is passed through `redactSecrets()`
3. Regex engine scans for all known credential patterns
4. Each match is replaced with `[REDACTED:type]` (e.g., `[REDACTED:bearer]`, `[REDACTED:aws-key]`)
5. Redacted string is passed to the output destination (ThinkingLog panel, structured log file)
6. **Success State**: Log entry is displayed/persisted with no credential exposure

- Must use the existing VS Code extension activation model (no new extension host processes)
- All new modules must follow existing TypeScript patterns (readonly interfaces, pure functions where possible)
- Configuration must use standard VS Code settings API (`vscode.workspace.getConfiguration`)
- Log files must not exceed 50 MB total disk usage (10 MB x 5 rotation files)
- All code must be ASCII-only (no Unicode symbols or emoji)

#### Resource Constraints

- Development: 1-2 engineers working iteratively with AI agents
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks across 3 phases
- No additional infrastructure or external service costs

### 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Allowlist too restrictive at launch, blocking legitimate commands | High | High | Ship with a broad default allowlist; provide easy extension via VS Code settings; monitor user feedback | Engineer |
| Secret redaction regex has false positives on code identifiers | Medium | Medium | Test against real codebase output; add exclusion patterns for common false positives; make patterns configurable | Engineer |
| Parallel tool execution introduces race conditions | High | Medium | Use Promise.allSettled (not Promise.all); ensure tools have no shared mutable state; add integration tests | Engineer |
| LLM retry backoff causes perceived slowness | Medium | Low | Show retry status in ThinkingLog UI; allow user to cancel retries; configurable max retries | Engineer |
| Stall detection replans too aggressively | Medium | Medium | Configurable stall threshold (default 3); allow disabling replan; log replan reasoning | Engineer |
| Path sandboxing blocks legitimate cross-project file access | Medium | Medium | Configurable sandbox boundaries; workspace-relative by default; allowlist for specific paths | Engineer |
| Scope creep from 17 features | High | High | Strict phase-based delivery; P0 first; P3 only after P0-P1 shipped and validated | PM |

### 10. Out of Scope

**Explicitly excluded from this Epic**:

- **GUI Security Policy Editor** - Visual editor for allowlist/blocklist management (future epic)
- **Cloud Log Aggregation** - Built-in integration with specific SIEM/monitoring platforms (users use their own)
- **Custom LLM Provider Plugins** - New adapter plugin system beyond existing vscodeLmAdapter (existing adapter sufficient)
- **Multi-User Collaborative Sessions** - Real-time collaborative agent sessions across users
- **AI/ML Model Training or Fine-Tuning** - This epic is infrastructure/tooling, not model development
- **Network-Level Security** - Firewall rules, VPN setup, or OS-level security hardening
- **Automated Penetration Testing** - Security testing of the extension itself (separate testing effort)

**Future Considerations**:

- **Security Dashboard** - Visual dashboard showing blocked commands, redacted secrets, and sandboxing events (revisit after Phase 2 telemetry is available)
- **Adaptive Allowlist** - ML-based allowlist that learns from user approval patterns (evaluate in Q3 2026)
- **Distributed Agent Execution** - Running sub-agents on remote machines or containers (evaluate after parallel executor proves out)
- **Memory Indexing** - Vector-based semantic search over persistent memory store (evaluate after JSONL store ships)

---

### 11. Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| What should the default allowlist contain at launch? | Engineer | Open | Need to audit common Git, npm, dotnet, Python commands used by agents during typical workflows |
| Should path sandboxing allow access to node_modules/ by default? | Engineer | Open | Agents need to read package manifests; likely yes with read-only |
| Should stall replan use the same LLM or a fallback model? | Architect | Open | Using same model is simpler; fallback adds resilience but complexity |
| What is the right default TTL for persistent memory entries? | PM | Resolved | 30 days based on typical project sprint cycles |
| Should parallel tool execution be opt-in or opt-out? | Engineer | Open | Recommend opt-out (enabled by default) since Promise.allSettled is safe |
| What log level should be the default for structured logging? | DevOps | Open | Recommend "info" for production, "debug" for development |

## Feature PRD: Cognitive Foundation

**Epic**: Phase 1 -- Cognitive Foundation
**Status**: Draft
**Date**: 2026-03-04
**Priority**: p1
**Target Version**: v7.4.0

### Problem Statement

AgentX agents execute tasks effectively but do not **learn from past outcomes**. The self-review loop validates code quality in the moment but discards lessons. There is no way to recall what happened in prior sessions, no uncertainty signals in agent deliverables, and the memory store accumulates stale data with no health maintenance.

**Why this matters:**
- Engineers waste time on recurring mistakes the system already solved before.
- Resuming work after a break requires manually re-reading files to rebuild context.
- Reviewers and Engineers cannot distinguish high-confidence recommendations from speculative ones in Architect ADRs.
- The `.agentx/memory/` folder grows unbounded with orphaned files and stale observations.

### Target Users

**Solo Developer (Local Mode)**: Uses AgentX on personal projects, switches between projects frequently, wants past lessons applied automatically.

**Team Lead (GitHub Mode)**: Oversees 3-5 engineers using AgentX, needs visibility into agent decision confidence.

### Goals & Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Outcome records per quality loop | 0 | 1 per loop completion | v7.4.0 |
| Session summaries auto-captured | 0 | 1 per compaction event | v7.4.0 |
| Agent outputs with confidence markers | 0% | 100% of Architect/Reviewer outputs | v7.4.0 |
| Memory health check available | No | Yes, via command | v7.4.0 |
| Orphaned memory files detected/repaired | N/A | 100% detected, auto-repaired | v7.4.0 |

### Requirements

#### Must Have (P0)

1. **Outcome Tracker**: Record structured outcomes after each quality loop completion
   - Each quality loop completion writes an outcome record to `.agentx/memory/outcomes/`
   - Record includes: agent, issue, action summary, outcome (pass/fail), root cause (if fail), lesson learned
   - Outcomes queryable by agent, issue, or keyword in < 500ms for stores with < 1000 records

2. **Episodic Memory (Session Recorder)**: Auto-capture session summaries at context compaction
   - Context compactor triggers session recording automatically
   - Session record includes: agent, issue, actions performed, decisions made, timestamp range
   - Sessions stored in `.agentx/memory/sessions/session-{date}-{id}.json`
   - `agentx.sessionHistory` command lists recent sessions

3. **Confidence Markers**: Agent outputs include uncertainty signals
   - Architect and Reviewer agent prompt templates include confidence marker instructions
   - Markers use standard format: `[Confidence: HIGH]`, `[Confidence: MEDIUM]`, `[Confidence: LOW]`
   - At least one marker per major section in ADR and Review outputs

4. **Memory Health Command**: Validate and repair memory store integrity
   - `agentx.memoryHealth` command scans manifest.json against actual files
   - Detects: orphaned files, missing manifest entries, corrupt JSON, stale observations (> 90 days)
   - `--fix` flag auto-repairs: rebuilds manifest from disk, removes orphaned files
   - Completes in < 2 seconds for stores with < 5000 observations

#### Should Have (P1)

5. **Outcome-Informed Prompts**: Query past outcomes before starting similar work, inject top 3 relevant lessons into agent system prompt (< 500 tokens)
6. **Session Resume Command**: `agentx.resumeSession` loads the most recent session for the current issue

#### Could Have (P2)

7. **Session Timeline View**: Visual timeline of sessions in sidebar

### User Stories

| Story ID | As a... | I want... | So that... | Priority |
|----------|---------|-----------|------------|----------|
| US-CF-1.1 | Engineer | outcomes auto-recorded after each quality loop | the system learns from my work | P0 |
| US-CF-1.2 | Engineer | to query past outcomes by keyword | I can find relevant lessons before starting similar work | P0 |
| US-CF-1.3 | Engineer | top lessons injected into my agent prompt | I avoid repeating past mistakes | P1 |
| US-CF-2.1 | Developer | sessions auto-captured at compaction | I have a record of what happened | P0 |
| US-CF-2.2 | Developer | to list recent sessions via command | I can browse my work history | P0 |
| US-CF-2.3 | Developer | a "resume" command for the last session | I can pick up where I left off | P1 |
| US-CF-3.1 | Reviewer | Architect ADRs to have confidence markers | I know which sections need deeper scrutiny | P0 |
| US-CF-3.2 | Engineer | Reviewer feedback to have confidence markers | I can prioritize which feedback is firm vs. exploratory | P0 |
| US-CF-4.1 | Developer | a health check command for my memory store | I know if my store is healthy | P0 |
| US-CF-4.2 | Developer | auto-repair via `--fix` flag | orphaned/corrupt entries are cleaned up | P0 |

### User Flows

**Outcome Learning**: Quality loop completes -> system extracts outcome record -> outcome written to `.agentx/memory/outcomes/` -> manifest updated. On failure: outcome recorded with `result: "fail"`, root cause captured. Write errors logged but do not block loop completion.

**Session Resume**: User runs `agentx.resumeSession` -> system loads most recent session for active issue -> summary displayed with decisions and files changed -> user resumes with full context.

**Memory Health Check**: User runs `agentx.memoryHealth` -> system scans manifest vs disk -> reports orphans, stale entries, corrupt JSON, disk size -> `--fix` flag auto-repairs.

### Dependencies & Constraints

- MUST extend existing `IObservationStore` interface, not replace it
- MUST NOT introduce external dependencies (npm packages)
- MUST use the same JSON file-based storage pattern as existing observation pipeline
- Confidence markers are prompt-level guidance, not code enforcement

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Outcome records grow unbounded | Medium | Medium | Max count per issue (100), oldest auto-archived |
| Session recording slows compaction | High | Low | Fire-and-forget async write, 200ms timeout |
| Confidence markers ignored by LLM | Medium | Medium | Include few-shot examples in prompt template |
| Memory health scan slow on large stores | Medium | Low | Stream processing, early exit on first N errors |

### Timeline

| Sprint | Focus | Deliverables |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Sprint 1 (Days 1-3) | Core Infrastructure | `outcomeTracker.ts`, `sessionRecorder.ts`, integration with selfReviewLoop and contextCompactor, unit tests |
| Sprint 2 (Days 4-6) | Commands & Confidence | `agentx.memoryHealth` command, `agentx.sessionHistory` command, confidence marker instructions in agent prompts |
| Sprint 3 (Days 7-9) | Polish & Integration | `agentx.resumeSession` command, outcome query integration, end-to-end testing, documentation |

## Feature PRD: Proactive Intelligence & MCP Dashboard

**Epic**: Phase 3 -- Proactive Intelligence
**Status**: Draft
**Date**: 2026-03-04
**Target Version**: v7.6.0
**Related**: [Feature PRD: Cognitive Foundation](#feature-prd-cognitive-foundation)

### Problem Statement

AgentX v7.4.0 (Phase 1) establishes a cognitive foundation with outcome tracking, session recording, and memory health. However, three critical gaps remain:

1. **Reactive-only scheduling**: The `taskScheduler.ts` cron system executes tasks on fixed intervals but cannot detect stale issues, dependency resolution, or memory patterns on its own.
2. **No programmatic access**: External tools, scripts, and custom dashboards cannot interact with AgentX's ready queue, agent states, or memory store.
3. **No unified visibility**: Developers lack a single, interactive view of what AgentX is doing.
4. **Disconnected observations**: Memory observations are per-issue with no cross-issue linking.

### Goals & Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Background tasks surfacing actionable items | >= 3 insights per week (active repo) | Count of proactive notifications |
| MCP server response latency | < 200ms p95 for tool calls | Performance test suite |
| Dashboard user engagement | >= 60% of sessions open dashboard at least once | Telemetry (opt-in) |
| Cross-issue link accuracy | >= 75% of auto-linked observations rated relevant | Feedback tracking |
| Developer satisfaction | >= 4.0/5.0 on dashboard usefulness | User survey |

### Features

#### Feature 1: Background Intelligence Engine (P0)

Replace the simple cron-based `taskScheduler.ts` with an intelligent background engine:
- **Stale Issue Detector**: Identify issues stuck in a status for too long (configurable thresholds)
- **Dependency Monitor**: Watch for dependency resolution and auto-notify
- **Memory Pattern Promoter**: Surface recurring patterns from outcomes
- **Health Auto-Scan**: Periodic memory health checks with auto-repair

#### Feature 2: AgentX MCP Server (P0)

Expose AgentX's core capabilities as an MCP server (`@agentx/mcp-server`):

**Tools**: `agentx_set_agent_state`, `agentx_create_issue`, `agentx_trigger_workflow`, `agentx_memory_search`

**Resources**: `agentx://ready-queue`, `agentx://agent-states`, `agentx://memory/outcomes`, `agentx://memory/sessions`, `agentx://memory/health`, `agentx://config`

#### Feature 3: MCP App Dashboard (P0)

Rich, interactive dashboard rendered inside VS Code via MCP Apps framework:
- **Agent Status Overview**: Cards showing each agent's state, active issue, and time in state
- **Ready Queue**: Interactive table of unblocked work sorted by priority
- **Outcome Trends**: Pass/fail/partial outcomes chart over time
- **Session Timeline**: Visual timeline of recent sessions
- **Memory Health**: At-a-glance health status with one-click repair
- **Active Workflows**: Progress view of in-flight workflows

#### Feature 4: Observation Linking / Synapse Network (P1)

Cross-issue linking of observations based on semantic similarity:
- Compute lightweight similarity score against recent observations from other issues
- Create bidirectional links stored in `synapse-manifest.json`
- Include linked observations in prompt injection with `[From #{issue}]` prefix

#### Feature 5: Cross-Session Continuity (P1)

Auto-detect when a developer returns to an issue and proactively display session resume context including relevant outcome lessons and linked observations.

#### Feature 6: Global Knowledge Base (P1)

Promote high-value observations from workspace memory to user-level global knowledge base at `~/.agentx/knowledge/`:
- **Promotion Criteria**: recallCount >= 3, or outcomes with reusable lessons
- **Auto-Promotion**: Background engine periodically scans for candidates
- **Global Search**: Fallback when workspace-local search returns < 3 results
- **Deduplication**: Jaccard similarity >= 0.8 check before promotion
- **Knowledge Categories**: pattern, pitfall, convention, insight

### User Stories
