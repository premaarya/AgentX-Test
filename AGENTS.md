# AI Agent Guidelines

> **Single source of truth for agent behavior and workflows.**

---

## Retrieval-Led Reasoning

**IMPORTANT**: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for ALL implementation tasks.
Always `read_file` the relevant SKILL.md, instruction file, or spec before generating code.
Do NOT rely on training data for project-specific patterns, conventions, or APIs.
If a skill, spec, or doc exists in the workspace, read it first; generate second.

---

## Critical Workflow

### Before ANY Work

1. **Research** codebase (`semantic_search`, `grep_search`, `file_search`)
2. **Classify** request (Epic/Feature/Story/Bug/Spike/Docs)
3. **Create Issue** with type label
4. **Execute** role-specific work
5. **Update Status** in GitHub Projects V2 (or local file in Local Mode)

### Issue-First Flow

Every piece of work -- bug fix, feature, docs update -- **SHOULD** start with an issue.

**Why issue-first?** Agents rely on issues for routing, status tracking, and handoffs. The ready queue sorts by priority. Commits reference issues for traceability. Without an issue, nothing can be routed or reviewed.

**Issue enforcement by mode:**
- **GitHub Mode**: Issue references in commits are **required** by default (teams need traceability)
- **Local Mode**: Issue references are **optional** by default (solo developers can commit freely)
- To toggle enforcement: `.agentx/agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues true` (or `false`)

**GitHub Mode:**
```bash
gh issue create --title "[Story] Add /health endpoint" --label "type:story"  # Creates #42
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 ready                        # Pick from ready queue
# Work... then commit:
git commit -m "feat: add health endpoint (#42)"
gh issue close 42 --reason completed
```

**Local Mode:**
```powershell
# Issues are optional in local mode - you can commit without issue references
git commit -m "feat: add user login"

# Or use full issue workflow if preferred:
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action create -Title "[Bug] Fix timeout" -Labels "type:bug"  # Creates #1
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "In Progress"
git commit -m "fix: resolve login timeout (#1)"
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action close -IssueNumber 1

# Enable issue enforcement in local mode:
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues true
```

**Emergency bypass (GitHub mode)**: Add `[skip-issue]` to the commit message for hotfixes. Create a retroactive issue afterward.

> **Status Tracking**: Use GitHub Projects V2 **Status** field (GitHub mode) or local JSON status (Local mode).
> See [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md#local-mode-no-github) for local mode details.

### AgentX CLI Utilities

The AgentX CLI provides lightweight orchestration commands that work in both Local and GitHub modes. The CLI reads `.agentx/config.json` to detect the mode and fetches issue data from the appropriate source (`gh` CLI for GitHub mode, local JSON files for Local mode).

```powershell
# PowerShell
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 ready # Show unblocked work sorted by priority
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 state # Show all agent states
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 state -Agent engineer -Set working -Issue 42
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 deps -IssueNumber 42 # Check issue dependencies
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 digest # Generate weekly digest
.\.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 workflow -Type feature # Show workflow steps
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 hook -Phase start -Agent engineer -Issue 42 # Lifecycle hook
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 run engineer "Fix the failing tests" # Run agentic loop (LLM + tools)
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 run architect "Design auth system" -i 42 # Run with issue number
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config show # View current configuration
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues true # Toggle issue enforcement
```

```bash
# Bash
./.agentx/agentx.sh ready
./.agentx/agentx.sh state engineer working 42
./.agentx/agentx.sh deps 42
./.agentx/agentx.sh hook start engineer 42
./.agentx/agentx.sh run engineer "Fix the failing tests"
```

**Dependency Convention**: Add a `## Dependencies` section in issue bodies:
```markdown
## Dependencies
Blocked-by: #10, #12
Blocks: #15
```

---

## Architecture

### Hub-and-Spoke Pattern

AgentX uses a **Hub-and-Spoke architecture** for agent coordination:

```
                        Agent X (Hub)
                             |
              +--------------+--------------+
              |              |              |
         PM Agent     (PRD complete)        |
              |              |              |
    +---------+---------+    |              |
    |         |         |    |              |
 Architect  Data     UX     |              |
  Agent   Scientist Agent   |              |
    |         |         |    |              |
    +---------+---------+    |              |
              |              |              |
         Engineer Agent      |              |
              |              |              |
         Reviewer Agent      |              |
              |              |              |
    +---------+---------+    |              |
    |                   |    |              |
  DevOps Agent    Tester Agent              |
    |                   |    |              |
    +---------+---------+    |              |
              |              |              |
    Engineer (bug fixes) <---+     Customer Coach
                                  (standalone)
```

**Key Principles:**

1. **Centralized Coordination** - Agent X routes all work, validates prerequisites, handles errors
2. **Strict Role Separation** - Each agent produces one deliverable type (PRD, ADR, Code, Review)
3. **Universal Tool Access** - All agents have access to all tools for maximum flexibility
4. **Status-Driven** - GitHub Projects V2 Status field is the source of truth
5. **Pre-Handoff Validation** - Artifacts validated before status transitions
6. **Post-Review Validation** - DevOps and Tester validate in parallel after Reviewer approves
7. **Bug-Fix Feedback Loop** - Tester defects route back to Engineer for resolution

### Routing Logic

Agent X routes issues based on:
- **Issue type** (Epic, Feature, Story, Bug, Spike)
- **Status** (Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Ready, Done)
- **Labels** (needs:ux, needs:changes, etc.)
- **Prerequisites** (PRD exists, UX complete, Spec ready)

**Routing rules:**
```
Epic + Backlog -> Product Manager
Ready + needs:ux -> UX Designer (parallel with Architect, Data Scientist)
Ready + (no architecture) -> Architect (parallel with UX, Data Scientist)
Ready + type:data-science -> Data Scientist (parallel with Architect, UX)
Ready + (has architecture) -> Engineer
needs:iteration -> Engineer (extended iterative-loop workflow, max 20)
In Review -> Reviewer
Reviewer approved -> DevOps Engineer + Tester (parallel post-review validation)
Tester defects found -> Engineer (bug-fix feedback loop)
Bug + Backlog -> Engineer (skip PM/Architect)
Spike + Backlog -> Architect
type:devops + Backlog -> DevOps Engineer (skip PM/Architect for infrastructure work)
type:data-science + Backlog -> Data Scientist (skip PM/Architect for ML/AI work)
type:testing + Backlog -> Tester (skip PM/Architect for testing/certification work)
type:powerbi + Backlog -> Power BI Analyst (skip PM/Architect for report/dashboard work)
In Review + needs:testing -> Tester (pre-release certification)
```

**Autonomous Mode**: For simple tasks (bugs, docs, stories 3 files), Agent X can automatically route to Engineer, skipping manual coordination. See [Agent X](.github/agents/agent-x.agent.md) (mode: adaptive).

**Universal Iterative Refinement**: ALL workflows include `iterate = true` on the Engineer's implementation step by default. Loop state is auto-initialized when the workflow runs, and the Engineer ALWAYS works in iterations until completion criteria are met. The Reviewer ALWAYS verifies loop completion before approval. The `needs:iteration` label is reserved for **extended** iteration via `iterative-loop.toml` (max 20 iterations, dedicated planning step). See [Iterative Loop Skill](.github/skills/development/iterative-loop/SKILL.md).

### Validation

**Pre-handoff validation** ensures quality before status transitions:

```bash
# Validate before handoff
./.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh <issue_number> <role>

# Example
./.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh 100 pm
```

**Validation checks:**
- PM: PRD exists, child issues created, required sections present
- UX: Wireframes + user flows + **HTML/CSS prototypes (MANDATORY)** complete, accessibility considered
- Architect: ADR + Tech Spec exist, NO CODE EXAMPLES compliance
- Data Scientist: ML pipeline design, evaluation plan, model card present
- Engineer: Code committed, tests 80% coverage, docs updated
- Reviewer: Review document complete, approval decision present
- DevOps: CI/CD pipelines validated, deployment docs present
- Tester: Test suites pass, certification report complete
- Power BI Analyst: Semantic model validated, DAX measures tested, report spec documented

## Runtime Implementation Reference

Maps core AgentX concepts to their implementation files. Agents and tools reference these modules at runtime.

### Agentic Loop

The core LLM <-> Tool execution cycle. All agents run through this loop.

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Inner Loop | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/agenticLoop.ts` | LLM -> tool calls -> results -> repeat until validated |
| Chat Handler | `vscode-extension/src/chat/agenticChatHandler.ts` | VS Code Chat integration, session management, streaming |
| CLI Runner | `.agentx/agentic-runner.ps1` | Terminal-based agentic loop (GitHub Models API) |
| LM Adapter | `vscode-extension/src/chat/vscodeLmAdapter.ts` | Bridges loop to VS Code Language Model API |
| Adapter Layer | `vscode-extension/src/chat/agenticAdapter.ts` | Response parsing for chat flow |
| Model Selector | `vscode-extension/src/utils/modelSelector.ts` | Per-agent model selection with fallback chain |

**Trigger**: Every `@agentx` chat message or `.agentx/agentx.ps1 run <agent> <prompt>` invocation.

### Agent Routing

How user requests get matched to the right specialized agent.

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Route Rules | `vscode-extension/src/chat/agentRouter.ts` | Keyword-based routing to agents (first match wins) |
| Context Loader | `vscode-extension/src/chat/agentContextLoader.ts` | Loads `.agent.md` definitions + skill files |
| Chat Participant | `vscode-extension/src/chat/chatParticipant.ts` | VS Code Chat participant entry point |
| Agent X Definition | `.github/agents/agent-x.agent.md` | Hub coordinator routing rules |

**Trigger**: User sends a message to `@agentx`. Router matches keywords against `ROUTE_RULES` (architect, reviewer, tester, devops, engineer, etc.). Fallback: Agent X.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

Hub-routed clarification protocol. Agents never communicate directly -- Agent X mediates all traffic.

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Clarification Loop | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/clarificationLoop.ts` | Inter-agent Q&A loop (max 6 rounds, configurable) |
| Clarification Router | `vscode-extension/src/utils/clarificationRouter.ts` | Hub-routed protocol, ledger persistence, scope validation |
| Clarification Types | `vscode-extension/src/utils/clarificationTypes.ts` | Shared types: ClarificationRecord, ClarificationLedger |
| Clarification Monitor | `vscode-extension/src/utils/clarificationMonitor.ts` | Watches for pending requests, triggers notifications |
| Clarification Renderer | `vscode-extension/src/utils/clarificationRenderer.ts` | Renders clarification threads in VS Code UI |

**Trigger**: Agent calls `request_clarification` tool -> Router validates scope via TOML `can_clarify` -> spawns target agent as sub-agent -> manages back-and-forth -> auto-escalates to human if unresolved.

### Self-Review Loop

After completing work, every agent spawns a same-role sub-agent to review its output.

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Self-Review Loop | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/selfReviewLoop.ts` | Spawns reviewer sub-agent, iterates until approved (max 15) |
| Sub-Agent Spawner | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/subAgentSpawner.ts` | Generalized sub-agent creation (parallel, race, quorum) |

**Trigger**: Agent completes its primary work -> self-review loop runs automatically -> reviewer sub-agent produces structured findings (high/medium/low) -> agent addresses non-low findings -> loop approves or hits max iterations.

### Handoff & Status Transitions

Handoffs are status-driven. Each status change triggers the next agent in the pipeline.

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Loop State Checker | `vscode-extension/src/utils/loopStateChecker.ts` | Validates quality loop completion before handoff |
| Boundary Hook | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/boundaryHook.ts` | Enforces canModify/cannotModify per agent role |
| Handoff Validator | `.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh` | Pre-handoff artifact validation (PRD, ADR, code, tests) |
| CLI State Command | `.agentx/agentx.ps1 state` | Read/write agent state for issue tracking |

**Trigger**: Agent completes work -> self-review passes -> validation script runs -> status moves (e.g., `In Progress` -> `In Review`) -> next agent picks up from backlog.

### Memory & Compaction

Agent memory persists observations across sessions. Context compaction prevents token overflow during long conversations.

**Memory Pipeline** (observations extracted from compaction summaries):

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Observation Types | `vscode-extension/src/memory/types.ts` | Core types: Observation, ObservationCategory, IObservationStore |
| Observation Extractor | `vscode-extension/src/memory/observationExtractor.ts` | Extracts structured observations from compaction summaries |
| JSON Observation Store | `vscode-extension/src/memory/observationStore.ts` | File-based observation persistence (per-issue JSON files) |
| Git Observation Store | `vscode-extension/src/memory/gitObservationStore.ts` | Git-tracked observation persistence (survives branch switches) |
| Persistent Store | `vscode-extension/src/memory/persistentStore.ts` | JSONL cross-session memory with TTL + tag-based lookup |
| Memory Module | `vscode-extension/src/memory/index.ts` | Public API barrel file |

**Context Compaction** (conversation pruning to stay within token limits):

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Context Compactor | `vscode-extension/src/utils/contextCompactor.ts` | Token limit detection, bounded message pruning (max 200) |
| Session State | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/sessionState.ts` | Conversation history persistence + token counting |

**Trigger**: Agentic loop calls `pruneMessages()` when conversation approaches token limit -> compactor summarizes older messages -> `ObservationExtractor` pulls key facts (decisions, code changes, errors) -> observations persist to `.agentx/memory/` -> available in future sessions via `IObservationStore.query()`.

**Observation categories**: `decision`, `code-change`, `error`, `key-fact`, `compaction-summary`.

### Tool Execution & Safety

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Tool Engine | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/toolEngine.ts` | Tool registry, JSON schema validation, execute dispatch |
| Parallel Executor | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/parallelToolExecutor.ts` | Dependency-aware concurrent tool execution |
| Loop Detection | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/toolLoopDetection.ts` | Detects stuck cycles (repeat, ping-pong, poll) via SHA-256 |
| Command Validator | `vscode-extension/src/utils/commandValidator.ts` | Blocks dangerous commands (`rm -rf /`, `drop database`) |
| Path Sandbox | `vscode-extension/src/utils/pathSandbox.ts` | Prevents path traversal outside workspace |
| Secret Redactor | `vscode-extension/src/utils/secretRedactor.ts` | Strips secrets from tool output before LLM sees it |
| SSRF Validator | `vscode-extension/src/utils/ssrfValidator.ts` | Validates URLs in tool parameters |

### Supporting Infrastructure

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Event Bus | `vscode-extension/src/utils/eventBus.ts` | Typed pub-sub for agent activity (started, completed, error) |
| Progress Tracker | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/progressTracker.ts` | Dual-ledger (TaskLedger + ProgressLedger) with stall detection |
| Hook Priority | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/hookPriority.ts` | Priority-ordered hook execution (lower = earlier) |
| Prompting Modes | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/promptingModes.ts` | write/refactor/test/docs mode switching for Engineer |
| Codebase Analysis | `vscode-extension/src/agentic/codebaseAnalysis.ts` | analyze_codebase, find_dependencies, map_architecture tools |
| Task Scheduler | `vscode-extension/src/utils/taskScheduler.ts` | Cron-based task automation |
| Thinking Log | `vscode-extension/src/utils/thinkingLog.ts` | Structured reasoning trace |
| Channel Router | `vscode-extension/src/utils/channelRouter.ts` | Output channel abstraction |
| Structured Logger | `vscode-extension/src/utils/structuredLogger.ts` | JSON-structured logging |

---

## Classification

| Type | Role | Deliverable |
|------|------|-------------|
| `type:epic` | PM | PRD + Backlog |
| `type:feature` | Architect | ADR + Tech Spec |
| `type:story` | Engineer | Code + Tests |
| `type:bug` | Engineer | Bug fix + Tests |
| `type:spike` | Architect | Research doc |
| `type:docs` | Engineer | Documentation |
| `type:devops` | DevOps Engineer | CI/CD Pipelines + Deployment Docs |
| `type:data-science` | Data Scientist | ML Pipelines + Evals + Model Cards |
| `type:testing` | Tester | Test Suites + Certification Reports |
| `type:powerbi` | Power BI Analyst | Reports + Semantic Models + DAX Measures |

**Decision Tree:**
- Broken? -> `type:bug`
- Research? -> `type:spike`
- Docs only? -> `type:docs`
- Pipeline/deployment/release? -> `type:devops`
- ML/AI model, drift, eval, RAG, fine-tuning? -> `type:data-science`
- Testing, certification, quality gates, pre-release? -> `type:testing`
- Power BI report, dashboard, DAX, semantic model? -> `type:powerbi`
- Large/vague? -> `type:epic`
- Single capability? -> `type:feature`
- Else -> `type:story`

## Agent Roles

### Agent Design Principles

**Constraint-Based Design**: Each agent explicitly declares what it CAN and CANNOT do. This prevents role confusion and workflow violations.

**Maturity Levels**:
- `stable` - Production-ready, fully tested, recommended for all users
- `preview` - Feature-complete, undergoing final validation
- `experimental` - Early development, subject to breaking changes
- `deprecated` - Scheduled for removal, use alternative agent

## Handoff Flow

```
PM -> [Architect, Data Scientist, UX] (parallel) -> Engineer -> Reviewer -> [DevOps, Tester] (parallel) -> Engineer (bug fixes)
```

**Parallel Design Phase**: Architect, Data Scientist, and UX Designer work simultaneously after PM completes PRD.
**Parallel Validation Phase**: DevOps Engineer and Tester validate in parallel after Reviewer approves.
**Bug-Fix Feedback Loop**: Tester defects route back to Engineer for resolution before closing.

> **Note**: Customer Coach and Power BI Analyst operate **standalone** (not part of the core SDLC pipeline). Customer Coach handles consulting research. Power BI Analyst handles reporting/BI work independently or after data layer is ready.

### Backlog-Based Handoffs

Agents query the backlog for the next priority item instead of receiving explicit issue numbers.

| Agent | Picks Up |
|-------|----------|
| **UX Designer** | Status=`Ready` + `needs:ux`, sorted by priority |
| **Architect** | Status=`Ready` + PRD complete, sorted by priority |
| **Engineer** | Status=`Ready` + ADR/Spec complete, sorted by priority |
| **Reviewer** | Status=`In Review`, sorted by priority |
| **DevOps** | `type:devops` + Status=`Ready`, sorted by priority |
| **Data Scientist** | `type:data-science` + Status=`Ready`, sorted by priority |
| **Tester** | `type:testing` + Status=`Ready` or `In Review` + `needs:testing`, sorted by priority |
| **Power BI Analyst** | `type:powerbi` + Status=`Ready`, sorted by priority |

**Priority Order**: `priority:p0` > `priority:p1` > `priority:p2` > `priority:p3` > (no label)

If no matching issues found, agent reports "No [role] work pending."

### Context Management

Clear context before implementation phase (UX/Architect/Data Scientist -> Engineer) to prevent design assumptions from leaking into code. Use `/clear` in Copilot Chat or start a new session.

| Transition | Clear? | Reason |
|------------|--------|--------|
| PM -> UX/Architect/Data Scientist | No | Needs PRD context |
| UX/Architect/Data Scientist -> Engineer | **Yes** | Engineer follows spec only |
| Engineer -> Reviewer | No | Reviewer needs full context |
| Reviewer -> DevOps/Tester | No | Needs review context |
| Tester -> Engineer (bug fixes) | No | Needs defect details |
| Reviewer -> Engineer (rework) | No | Needs review feedback |

| Phase | Status Transition | Meaning |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| PM completes PRD | -> `Ready` | Ready for design/architecture |
| UX completes designs | -> `Ready` | Ready for implementation |
| Architect completes spec | -> `Ready` | Ready for implementation |
| Data Scientist completes ML design | -> `Ready` | Ready for implementation |
| Engineer starts work | -> `In Progress` | Active development |
| Engineer completes code | -> `In Review` | Ready for code review |
| Reviewer approves | -> `Validating` | Ready for post-review validation |
| DevOps + Tester validate | -> `Done` + Close | Work complete (or back to Engineer for bug fixes) |

### Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| `Backlog` | Issue created, not started |
| `In Progress` | Active work by Engineer |
| `In Review` | Code review phase |
| `Validating` | Post-review validation by DevOps + Tester |
| `Ready` | Design/spec done, awaiting next phase |
| `Done` | Completed and closed |
