# AI Agent Guidelines

> **AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE**: This document is the single source of truth for all agent behavior, workflows, and guidelines.

> **WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT**: Primary enforcement is through this AGENTS.md file. The Copilot instructions file ([.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)) is just a gate that enforces reading this document first. All agents MUST follow the workflows defined here.

> **HYBRID ORCHESTRATION**: AgentX uses a 3-layer hybrid model combining GraphQL (fast), Workflows (execution), and MCP (coordination). See [architecture decision doc](docs/architecture-decision-hybrid-orchestration.md) for details.

# ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Research → Classify → Create Issue → Execute

**Before ANY work:**
1. **Research** codebase/requirements based on your role
2. **Classify** request type (Epic/Feature/Story/Bug/Spike/Docs)
3. **Create Issue** with proper type label
4. **Claim Issue** (update status to appropriate phase)
5. **Execute** role-specific work
6. **Handoff** to next agent via orchestration labels

### Research Tools by Role

| Tool | Product Manager | Architect | Engineer |
|------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| `semantic_search` | Business logic, user flows | Architecture patterns | Implementation examples |
| `grep_search` | Requirements docs | API contracts | Code patterns |
| `file_search` | PRDs, specs | ADRs, design docs | Source files, tests |

---

## � Issue-First Workflow

> **MANDATORY**: Create issue BEFORE any file modification. See [.github/agents/*.agent.md](.github/agents/) for role-specific execution.

**MCP Commands:**
```json
// Create
{ "tool": "issue_write", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>", "method": "create", "title": "[Type] Description", "labels": ["type:story"] } }

// Claim (add orch label when starting work)
{ "tool": "update_issue", "args": { "issue_number": <ID>, "labels": ["type:story"] } }

// Close (set Status to Done in Projects board)
{ "tool": "update_issue", "args": { "issue_number": <ID>, "state": "closed" } }
```

**CLI Fallback:**
```bash
gh issue create --title "[Type] Description" --label "type:story"
# Claim by moving to 'In Progress' in Projects board
gh issue close <ID> --comment "✅ Completed in <SHA>"
```

    │
    ▼
3. CREATE ISSUE (Gate 2 - mandatory)
   └─ With proper type label matching your role
    │
    ▼
4. CLAIM ISSUE
   └─ Set Status to 'In Progress' in Projects board
    │
    ▼
5. EXECUTE AS THAT ROLE

## 🎯 Handoff Protocol (Mandatory Steps)

> **APPLIES TO**: All agent roles must follow this protocol when completing their work.

### When Completing Your Role:

#### Step 1: Document Your Work (Role-Specific)
- **PRODUCT MANAGER**: Create PRD at `docs/prd/PRD-{issue}.md`
- **ARCHITECT**: Create ADR at `docs/adr/ADR-{issue}.md` and Spec at `docs/specs/SPEC-{issue}.md`
- **UX DESIGNER**: Create UX design at `docs/ux/UX-{issue}.md`
- **ENGINEER**: Create/modify code files, tests, and documentation
- **REVIEWER**: Create review at `docs/reviews/REVIEW-{issue}.md`
- Commit with proper message format: `type: description (#issue)`
- Reference parent issues in commit body if hierarchical

#### Step 2: Update Issue State (Orchestration Label Only)
```json
// PRODUCT MANAGER completes planning phase:
// Set Status to 'Ready' in Projects board, add orchestration label
{ "tool": "update_issue", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>", "issue_number": <ID>, "labels": ["type:epic", "orch:pm-done"] } }

// ARCHITECT completes design work:
// Epic stays in 'Ready', adds completion signal
{ "tool": "update_issue", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>", "issue_number": <ID>, "labels": ["type:feature", "orch:architect-done"] } }

// UX DESIGNER completes design work:
// Epic stays in 'Ready', adds completion signal
{ "tool": "update_issue", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>", "issue_number": <ID>, "labels": ["type:epic", "orch:ux-done"] } }

// ENGINEER completes implementation:
// Set Status to 'In Review' in Projects board
{ "tool": "update_issue", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>", "issue_number": <ID>, "labels": ["type:story", "orch:engineer-done"] } }

// REVIEWER approves and closes:
// Issue closes, auto-moves to 'Done' in Projects
{ "tool": "update_issue", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>", "issue_number": <ID>, "state": "closed" } }
```

#### Step 3: Post Summary Comment
```json
{ "tool": "add_issue_comment", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>", "issue_number": <ID>, "body": "## ✅ Completed: [Role Name]\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- [List artifacts created]\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- [What needs to happen next]\n\n**Links:**\n- Commits: [SHA]\n- Child Issues: #X, #Y, #Z" } }
```

#### Step 4: Trigger Next Agent
```json
// Method A: Create child issues for next agent
{ "tool": "issue_write", "args": { "method": "create", "title": "[Type] Description", "body": "Parent: #<ID>\n\n## Description\n[Details]", "labels": ["type:story"] } }

// Method B: Trigger workflow directly via MCP
{ "tool": "run_workflow", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>", "workflow_id": "run-engineer.yml", "ref": "master", "inputs": { "issue_number": "<STORY_ID>" } } }
```

## 🔍 Handoff Decision Criteria

| From → To | Trigger Condition | Signal (Label) | Action Required |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Product Manager → UX Designer** | Complete backlog created (Epic→Features→Stories) | `orch:pm-done` on Epic | Create ALL child issues, trigger UX Designer workflow (sequential) |
| **UX Designer → Architect** | All UX designs complete (wireframes + prototypes) | `orch:ux-done` on Epic | Commit all UX docs, add label to Epic, triggers Architect (sequential) |
| **Architect → Engineer** | All Tech Specs complete (ADR + Specs for all items) | `orch:architect-done` on Epic | Commit all technical docs, Engineer can start Stories (sequential) |
| **Engineer → Reviewer** | Implementation complete, tests passing, code committed | `orch:engineer-done` on Story | Commit code, comment on Story with commit SHA |
| **Reviewer → Close** | Code review passed quality gates | Review approved in `docs/reviews/REVIEW-{issue}.md` | Close Story (auto-moves to Done in Projects) |

---

## ⚡ Orchestration Implementation Methods

### Automated Orchestration

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/agent-orchestrator.yml`

**Triggers automatically on label changes:**
- `type:epic` (no orch:pm-done) → Product Manager
- `orch:pm-done` → UX Designer (sequential)
- `orch:ux-done` → Architect (sequential)
- `orch:architect-done` → Engineer (sequential)
- `orch:engineer-done` → Reviewer

**How it works:**
1. Agent completes work → adds `orch:*-done` label
2. Orchestrator detects label change
3. Routes to next agent automatically
4. Next agent executes

**Manual trigger** (if needed):
```bash
gh workflow run agent-orchestrator.yml -f issue_number=50
```

**MCP trigger** (via tools):
```json
{ "tool": "run_workflow", "args": { 
  "workflow_id": "agent-orchestrator.yml", 
  "inputs": { "issue_number": "50" } 
} }
```

---

## 🚨 Error Handling & Recovery

| Error Scenario | Detection Method | Resolution Steps | Owner |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Agent fails to complete** | Timeout after 15 minutes | Add `needs:help` label, notify user | System |
| **Child issue not created** | No child issues after `orch:*-done` label added | Re-run agent workflow with same issue number | User/System |
| **Circular dependency** | Issue references itself as parent | Manual intervention required, break cycle | User |
| **Missing artifacts** | No PRD/ADR/Spec/Code files committed | Remove `orch:*-done` label, restart agent | User/System |
| **Test failures** | CI/CD pipeline fails after commit | Add `needs:fixes` label, reassign to Engineer | System |
| **Review rejected** | Reviewer adds `needs:changes` label | Remove `orch:engineer-done`, Engineer fixes issues | Reviewer |
| **UX design missing** | Engineer starts but Epic lacks `orch:ux-done` label | Block Engineer, notify UX Designer, add `needs:help` label to Epic | System |
| **Architect spec missing** | Engineer starts but Epic lacks `orch:architect-done` label | Block Engineer, notify Architect, add `needs:help` label to Epic | System |

---

## 📊 Orchestration Metrics & SLAs

### Target Service Level Agreements

| Handoff | Target Time | Measured By |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| PM → UX Designer | <30 seconds | Time between `orch:pm-done` on Epic and UX Designer workflow start |
| UX Designer → Architect | <30 seconds | Time between `orch:ux-done` and Architect workflow start |
| Architect → Engineer | <30 seconds | Time between `orch:architect-done` and Engineer starting any Story |
| Engineer → Reviewer | <30 seconds | Time between `orch:engineer-done` and Reviewer workflow start |
| Reviewer → Close | <5 minutes | Time from review document creation to issue closure |

### Quality Gates (All Must Pass)

- ✅ All required artifacts created per role requirements
- ✅ All tests passing with ≥80% code coverage
- ✅ No security violations detected (secrets, SQL injection, XSS)
- ✅ All child issues properly linked with "Parent: #X" in body
- ✅ Commit messages follow format: `type: description (#issue)`

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

See [docs/orchestration-testing-guide.md](docs/orchestration-testing-guide.md) for:

- **E2E Test Scenarios** - 5 complete flows (Epic → Feature → Story → Review)
- **Validation Scripts** - Automated checks for each handoff
- **Cleanup Scripts** - Remove test data after validation
- **Coverage Goals** - Maintain >85% test coverage across all agents

---

## 🤖 The Orchestrator Agent

> **Purpose**: Central coordinator managing handoffs, routing, and workflow state transitions between all agents.

### Role & Responsibilities

The Orchestrator is a **meta-agent** that doesn't write code or create artifacts—instead, it **manages the workflow** itself:

- **Monitors** orchestration labels (`orch:*`) for state changes
- **Routes** issues to appropriate agents based on type and completion state
- **Validates** prerequisites before allowing handoffs (Epic has ADR, UX designs, etc.)
- **Sequences** workflow (PM → UX → Architect → Engineer → Reviewer)
- **Blocks** issues when prerequisites aren't met (clear error messages)
- **Recovers** from errors (timeouts, missing artifacts, circular dependencies)
- **Tracks** metrics (handoff latency, stage duration, SLA compliance)

### Invocation

**Automatic Mode** (Recommended) - Via `.github/workflows/agent-orchestrator.yml`:
- Triggers automatically when issues are labeled
- Detects `type:*` labels (new issue classification)
- Detects `orch:*-done` labels (agent handoff signals)

**Manual Trigger** (if needed):
```bash
gh workflow run agent-orchestrator.yml -f issue_number=71
```

### Orchestrator State Machine

```
Epic (type:epic)
  ├─ No orch:pm-done → Route to Product Manager
  ├─ orch:pm-done, no orch:ux-done → Route to UX Designer (sequential)
  ├─ orch:ux-done, no orch:architect-done → Route to Architect (sequential)
  └─ orch:architect-done → Unblock child Stories for Engineer

Story/Feature (type:story, type:feature)
  ├─ Check parent Epic prerequisites (orch:ux-done required)
  ├─ No orch:engineer-done → Route to Engineer (if prerequisites met)
  └─ orch:engineer-done → Route to Reviewer

Bug/Docs (type:bug, type:docs)
  ├─ No orch:engineer-done → Route to Engineer
  └─ orch:engineer-done → Route to Reviewer

Spike (type:spike)
  ├─ No orch:architect-done → Route to Architect
  └─ orch:architect-done → Close with findings
```

### Error Handling

The Orchestrator detects and recovers from common issues:

| Error | Detection | Recovery |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Agent timeout** | No `orch:*-done` after 15 min | Add `needs:help` label, comment with error |
| **Missing artifacts** | `orch:*-done` but no files committed | Remove completion label, re-run agent |
| **Blocked issue** | Prerequisites not met | Add blocking comment, pause routing |
| **Circular dependency** | Issue references itself as parent | Add `needs:resolution`, notify user |
| **Test failures** | CI pipeline fails after commit | Add `needs:fixes`, reassign to Engineer |

### Metrics & Monitoring

The Orchestrator tracks workflow health:

- **Handoff Latency**: Time between `orch:*-done` and next agent start (SLA: <30s)
- **Stage Duration**: How long each agent takes to complete
- **Workflow Throughput**: Issues completed per day
- **Blocking Frequency**: How often issues are blocked
- **SLA Compliance**: % of handoffs meeting <30s target

### Design Thinking Integration (IDEO Methodology)

The Orchestrator aligns AgentX workflow with **IDEO's human-centered design methodology**:

| IDEO Phase | AgentX Agent | Deliverables | Gate |
|------------|--------------|--------------|------|
| **1. Empathize** | Future: Researcher | User research, interviews, personas | → Define |
| **2. Define** | Product Manager | PRD, problem statement, user stories | → Ideate (UX) |
| **3. Ideate (UX)** | UX Designer | Wireframes, prototypes, user flows | → Ideate (Tech) |
| **3. Ideate (Tech)** | Architect | ADR, specs, technical design | → Prototype |
| **4. Prototype** | Engineer | Working code, interactive demos, tests | → Test |
| **5. Test** | Reviewer + Tester | Quality verification, user feedback | → Iterate/Ship |

**Key Principle**: The Orchestrator **enforces "design before build"** by following a **user-centered approach**. UX Designer (`orch:ux-done`) creates the user experience first, then Architect (`orch:architect-done`) designs the technical implementation to support that UX. Engineer starts only after this **sequential chain** completes.

**Example Flow**:
```
User Need: "Search is too slow"
    ↓ EMPATHIZE
Research findings: 78% abandon after 2 attempts
    ↓ DEFINE (Product Manager)
PRD: Epic #100 - Intelligent Search System
    ↓ IDEATE (UX first, sequential)
UX: Search UI redesign + filters
    ↓ IDEATE (Architect second, sequential)
Architect: Elasticsearch architecture (reads UX design)
    ↓ PROTOTYPE (Engineer - BLOCKED until architect-done)
Stories #101-103: Implementation
    ↓ TEST (Reviewer)
Security + performance verification
    ↓ SHIP or ITERATE
```

### Autonomous Subagents

The Orchestrator can delegate focused tasks without triggering full workflows:

```javascript
// Quick research
await runSubagent({
  prompt: "Research top 3 OAuth providers for .NET. Compare pricing and features.",
  description: "Auth provider research"
});

// Feasibility check before routing
await runSubagent({
  prompt: "Assess technical feasibility of real-time collaboration. Include effort estimate.",
  description: "Feasibility check"
});

// Quality audit
await runSubagent({
  prompt: "Audit React components for WCAG 2.1 AA violations.",
  description: "Accessibility audit"
});
```

**When to Use**:
- Quick investigations without creating issues
- Feasibility checks before committing to full workflow  
- Parallel quality audits
- Research synthesis

### Approval Gates (Optional)

Configure human approval checkpoints in [orchestration-config.yml](.github/orchestration-config.yml):

```yaml
approval_gates:
  - workflow: "feature-workflow"
    stage: "architect"
    require_approval: false  # Set true to enable
    reason: "Architectural decisions need review"
    approvers: ["architects", "security-team"]
```

When enabled, Orchestrator pauses and waits for `/approve` command before proceeding.
- **Workflow Throughput**: Issues completed per day
- **Blocking Frequency**: How often issues get blocked
- **SLA Compliance**: % of handoffs meeting <30s target

### Integration Points

## 🔄 Hybrid Status Tracking

> **Architecture**: Uses GitHub Projects v2 Status field (native UI) for visual tracking

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User/Board: Drags issue to "In Progress" column            │
│      ↓                                                       │
│ Status Field: Automatically updated in Projects v2          │
│      ↓                                                       │
│ Agent: Uses orch:* labels for coordination only             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Benefits

| Aspect | GitHub Status Field |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Visual Tracking** | ✅ Clean board view with standard values |
| **Mutually Exclusive** | ✅ Automatic - only one status at a time |
| **Agent Coordination** | ✅ Uses orch:* labels (orch:pm-done, orch:architect-done, etc.) |
| **CLI Queries** | ✅ Easy: `gh issue list --label type:story` |
| **Source of Truth** | ✅ Single source - Projects Status field |

### Standard Status Values

| Status | When Used | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **📝 Backlog** | Issue created | Waiting to be claimed |
| **🚀 In Progress** | PM/Architect/UX/Engineer working | Active development |
| **👀 In Review** | Code review phase | Quality assurance |
| **✅ Done** | Completed | Closed and delivered |

**Optional (for granularity):**
| **🏗️ Ready** | Design complete | Architect + UX done, awaiting Engineer |

### Setup

1. **Create GitHub Project v2** - See [docs/project-setup.md](docs/project-setup.md)
2. **Add Status field** - Single-select with values: Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done, Ready (optional)

### Usage

**For Humans:**
- Use project board (drag & drop between status columns)
- Status updates automatically

**For Agents:**
- Check prerequisites: orch:* labels (orch:pm-done, orch:architect-done, etc.)
- Update status by moving issue in Projects board
- Add completion labels when done

---

## Labels Reference

> **Simplified Labels**: GitHub Projects v2 **Status field** provides visual tracking. Labels are used only for issue type and agent coordination.

| Category | Labels | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Type** | `type:epic`, `type:feature`, `type:story`, `type:bug`, `type:spike`, `type:docs` | Classify issue type, determines agent role |
| **Priority** | `priority:p0`, `priority:p1`, `priority:p2`, `priority:p3` | Determine urgency (p0=critical, p3=low) |
| **Orchestration** | `orch:pm-done`, `orch:architect-done`, `orch:ux-done`, `orch:engineer-done` | Signal handoff readiness (cumulative) |
| **Workflow** | `needs:ux`, `needs:help`, `needs:changes`, `needs:fixes` | Flag special requirements |

### Label Placement Rules

**Epic-Level Labels** (workflow coordination):
- `type:epic` - Always on Epic
- `orch:pm-done` - Added by PM, triggers UX Designer (sequential)
- `orch:ux-done` - Added by UX Designer when wireframes complete, triggers Architect (sequential)
- `orch:architect-done` - Added by Architect when design complete, allows Engineer to start (sequential)
- `priority:p0/p1/p2/p3` - Priority level

**Feature/Story-Level Labels** (work requirements):
- `type:feature`, `type:story`, `type:bug`, etc. - Issue classification
- `needs:ux` - **ONLY on Features/Stories** - Indicates UI/UX work required
- `needs:help` - Blocked or assistance needed
- `needs:changes` - Reviewer requested changes

**Important**: The `needs:ux` label is NEVER placed on Epics. The orchestrator automatically triggers UX Designer for all Epics when `orch:pm-done` is added. UX Designer checks child Features/Stories for `needs:ux` and exits early if no work is found.

### ⚠️ Removed: Custom Status Labels

Previously used `status:ready`, `status:planning`, `status:designing`, `status:implementing`, `status:reviewing`, `status:done`.

**Now**: Use GitHub Projects Status field with standard values (Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done) instead.

# 🛡️ OPERATIONAL CONTROLS

> **PRIORITY 5**: Safety limits, security, and execution modes.

## Execution Modes

### Standard Mode (Default)
- Pause at critical decisions
- Request confirmation before destructive operations
- Show progress and reasoning
- Allow user intervention at any step

### YOLO Mode (Autonomous)
- **Activation:** User says "YOLO" or "autonomous mode"
- **Behavior:** Fully autonomous execution without pauses
- **Deactivation:** User says "stop" or "exit YOLO"
- **Use Case:** When user trusts agent completely and wants fast execution

---

## Security Controls

### Blocked Commands (Never Execute)

```bash
rm -rf /                  # Destructive file operations
git reset --hard          # Loses uncommitted work
drop database            # Destructive database operations
curl <url> | bash        # Arbitrary code execution
```

### Iteration Limits

| Operation | Max Attempts | Reason |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| General task iterations | 15 | Prevent infinite loops |
| Bug fix attempts | 5 | Escalate to human if still broken |
| Test retries | 3 | Don't mask flaky tests |
| API retry attempts | 3 | Respect rate limits |

### Security Checklist (Before Every Commit)

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets, passwords, API keys
- ✅ All SQL queries use parameterization (no string concatenation)
- ✅ Input validation on all user inputs
- ✅ Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Sensitive data not logged
