## Critical Workflow

### Before ANY Work

1. **Research** codebase (`semantic_search`, `grep_search`, `file_search`)
2. **Classify** request (Epic/Feature/Story/Bug/Spike/Docs)
3. **Create Issue** with type label
4. **Execute** role-specific work
5. **Update Status** in GitHub Projects V2 (or local file in Local Mode)

### Issue-First Flow (Ideal)

Every piece of work -- bug fix, feature, docs update -- **MUST** start with an issue. The issue is the central coordination point that agents use for context, status tracking, and handoffs.

**Why issue-first?**
- Agents (PM, Architect, Engineer, Reviewer) rely on issue data to discover work
- The ready queue (`agentx.ps1 ready`) sorts unblocked issues by priority
- Commit messages reference issues for traceability (`feat: add login (#42)`)
- Reviews validate against acceptance criteria in the issue body
- Without an issue, agents have nothing to route, track, or review against

**GitHub Mode -- Step by Step:**

```
1. gh issue create --title "[Story] Add /health endpoint" --label "type:story"
   -> Creates issue #42 on the project board (status: Backlog)

2. Agent picks up issue from ready queue
   -> ./.agentx/agentx.ps1 ready

3. Agent works on issue, updates status
   -> Backlog -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done

4. Commit references issue
   -> git commit -m "feat: add health endpoint (#42)"

5. Reviewer validates against issue, closes it
   -> gh issue close 42 --reason completed
```

**Local Mode -- Step by Step:**

```
1. .\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action create -Title "[Bug] Fix login timeout" -Labels "type:bug"
   -> Creates issue #1 in .agentx/issues/1.json (status: Backlog)

2. Agent picks up issue from ready queue
   -> .\.agentx\agentx.ps1 ready

3. Agent works on issue, updates status
   -> .\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "In Progress"

4. Commit references issue
   -> git commit -m "fix: resolve login timeout (#1)"

5. Review and close
   -> .\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action close -IssueNumber 1
```

**Emergency bypass**: If you must commit without an issue (hotfix, typo), add `[skip-issue]` to the commit message. Create a retroactive issue afterward to maintain traceability.

### Issue Commands

**GitHub Mode:**
```bash
# Create issue (auto-added to Project board)
gh issue create --title "[Type] Description" --label "type:story"

# Update status via GitHub Projects (NOT labels!)
# Backlog -> In Progress -> In Review -> Ready -> Done

# Close issue
gh issue close <ID>
```

**Local Mode** (without GitHub):
```powershell
# Create issue
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action create -Title "[Type] Description" -Labels "type:story"

# Update status
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action update -IssueNumber <ID> -Status "In Progress"

# Close issue
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action close -IssueNumber <ID>
```

> [WARN] **Status Tracking**: Use GitHub Projects V2 **Status** field (GitHub mode) or local JSON status (Local mode).
> 
> **Local Mode**: See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md#local-mode-no-github) for filesystem-based issue tracking without GitHub.

### AgentX CLI Utilities

The AgentX CLI provides lightweight orchestration commands that work in both Local and GitHub modes. The CLI reads `.agentx/config.json` to detect the mode and fetches issue data from the appropriate source (`gh` CLI for GitHub mode, local JSON files for Local mode).

```powershell
# PowerShell
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 ready # Show unblocked work sorted by priority
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 state # Show all agent states
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 state -Agent engineer -Set working -Issue 42
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 deps -IssueNumber 42 # Check issue dependencies
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 digest # Generate weekly digest
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 workflow -Type feature # Show workflow steps
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 hook -Phase start -Agent engineer -Issue 42 # Lifecycle hook
```

```bash
# Bash
./.agentx/agentx.sh ready
./.agentx/agentx.sh state engineer working 42
./.agentx/agentx.sh deps 42
./.agentx/agentx.sh hook start engineer 42
```

**Dependency Convention**: Add a `## Dependencies` section in issue bodies:
```markdown
## Dependencies
Blocked-by: #10, #12
Blocks: #15
```

---

## Architecture

### Hub-and-Spoke Pattern

AgentX uses a **Hub-and-Spoke architecture** for agent coordination:

```
 Agent X (Hub)
 |
 --------------+--------------
 | | |
 PM Agent Architect Agent UX Agent
 | | |
 --------------+--------------
 |
 Engineer Agent
 |
 Reviewer Agent
```

**Key Principles:**

1. **Centralized Coordination** - Agent X routes all work, validates prerequisites, handles errors
2. **Strict Role Separation** - Each agent produces one deliverable type (PRD, ADR, Code, Review)
3. **Universal Tool Access** - All agents have access to all tools for maximum flexibility
4. **Status-Driven** - GitHub Projects V2 Status field is the source of truth
5. **Pre-Handoff Validation** - Artifacts validated before status transitions

### Routing Logic

Agent X routes issues based on:
- **Issue type** (Epic, Feature, Story, Bug, Spike)
- **Status** (Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Ready, Done)
- **Labels** (needs:ux, needs:changes, etc.)
- **Prerequisites** (PRD exists, UX complete, Spec ready)

**Routing rules:**
```
Epic + Backlog -> Product Manager
Ready + needs:ux -> UX Designer
Ready + (no architecture) -> Architect
Ready + (has architecture) -> Engineer
In Review -> Reviewer
Bug + Backlog -> Engineer (skip PM/Architect)
Spike + Backlog -> Architect
type:devops + Backlog -> DevOps Engineer (skip PM/Architect for infrastructure work)
```

**Autonomous Mode**: For simple tasks (bugs, docs, stories 3 files), Agent X can automatically route to Engineer, skipping manual coordination. See [Agent X](.github/agents/agent-x.agent.md) (mode: adaptive).

### Validation

**Pre-handoff validation** ensures quality before status transitions:

```bash
# Validate before handoff
./.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh <issue_number> <role>

# Example
./.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh 100 pm
```

**Validation checks:**
- PM: PRD exists, child issues created, required sections present
- UX: Wireframes + user flows + **HTML/CSS prototypes (MANDATORY)** complete, accessibility considered
- Architect: ADR + Tech Spec exist, NO CODE EXAMPLES compliance
- Engineer: Code committed, tests 80% coverage, docs updated
- Reviewer: Review document complete, approval decision present

---

## Classification

| Type | Role | Deliverable |
|------|------|-------------|
| `type:epic` | PM | PRD + Backlog |
| `type:feature` | Architect | ADR + Tech Spec |
| `type:story` | Engineer | Code + Tests |
| `type:bug` | Engineer | Bug fix + Tests |
| `type:spike` | Architect | Research doc |
| `type:docs` | Engineer | Documentation |
| `type:devops` | DevOps Engineer | CI/CD Pipelines + Deployment Docs |

**Decision Tree:**
- Broken? -> `type:bug`
- Research? -> `type:spike`
- Docs only? -> `type:docs`
- Pipeline/deployment/release? -> `type:devops`
- Large/vague? -> `type:epic`
- Single capability? -> `type:feature`
- Else -> `type:story`

## Agent Roles

### Agent Design Principles

**Constraint-Based Design**: Each agent explicitly declares what it CAN and CANNOT do. This prevents role confusion and workflow violations.

**Maturity Levels**:
- `stable` - Production-ready, fully tested, recommended for all users
- `preview` - Feature-complete, undergoing final validation
- `experimental` - Early development, subject to breaking changes
- `deprecated` - Scheduled for removal, use alternative agent

All AgentX core agents are currently **stable** (production-ready).

## Handoff Flow

```
PM -> UX (optional, parallel) -> Engineer -> Reviewer -> Done
 (down) Architect (parallel) -------(up)
```

**Parallel Work**: UX Designer and Architect can work simultaneously after PM completes PRD.

### Backlog-Based Handoffs

**Work Selection**: Agents query the backlog for the next priority item instead of receiving explicit issue numbers.

**Selection Criteria**:

| Agent | Queries Backlog For |
|-------|---------------------|
| **UX Designer** | Status=`Ready` + `needs:ux` label, sorted by priority |
| **Architect** | Status=`Ready` + PRD complete, sorted by priority (no UX dependency) |
| **Engineer** | Status=`Ready` + ADR/Spec complete, sorted by priority |
| **Reviewer** | Status=`In Review`, sorted by priority |
| **DevOps** | `type:devops` + Status=`Ready`, sorted by priority |

**Priority Order**: `priority:p0` > `priority:p1` > `priority:p2` > `priority:p3` > (no priority label)

**Handoff Query Example**:
```bash
# UX Designer queries for next work item:
gh issue list --label "needs:ux" --json number,title,labels \
 --jq '.[] | select(.labels[].name == "priority:p0" or .labels[].name == "priority:p1") | .number'
```

**Benefits**:
- [PASS] **Autonomous work distribution** - No manual issue assignment needed
- [PASS] **Priority-driven** - Highest priority work gets done first
- [PASS] **Flexible coordination** - Agents adapt to backlog changes dynamically
- [PASS] **Parallel work support** - Multiple agents can work on different priority items

**No Work Available**: If no matching issues found, agent reports "No [role] work pending" and waits for backlog updates.

### Context Management

**Critical Rule**: Manage context between major phase transitions to prevent assumption contamination and maintain focus.

| Transition | Clear Context? | Reason |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| PM -> UX | [FAIL] No | UX needs PRD context for design decisions |
| PM -> Architect | [FAIL] No | Architect needs PRD context for technical design |
| UX/Architect -> Engineer | [PASS] **YES** | Engineer follows spec only, not design assumptions |
| Engineer -> Reviewer | [FAIL] No | Reviewer needs full context for comprehensive review |
| Reviewer -> Engineer (rework) | [FAIL] No | Engineer needs review feedback |

**When to Clear Context**:
1. Before starting implementation (UX/Architect -> Engineer)
2. When switching from research to execution
3. When starting autonomous mode for simple tasks

**How to Clear Context**:
- **VS Code**: Use `/clear` command in Copilot Chat
- **Manual**: Close current agent session, open new session for next agent
- **Purpose**: Forces agent to rely on saved artifacts (PRD, ADR, Spec) rather than conversational assumptions

**Why This Matters**:
- [PASS] Prevents architect's design assumptions from leaking into code
- [PASS] Forces reliance on documented specs (better for teams)
- [PASS] Catches incomplete specifications early
- [PASS] Maintains clean separation between planning and execution

| Phase | Status Transition | Meaning |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| PM completes PRD | -> `Ready` | Ready for design/architecture |
| UX completes designs | -> `Ready` | Ready for architecture |
| Architect completes spec | -> `Ready` | Ready for implementation |
| Engineer starts work | -> `In Progress` | Active development |
| Engineer completes code | -> `In Review` | Ready for code review |
| Reviewer approves | -> `Done` + Close | Work complete |

### Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| `Backlog` | Issue created, not started |
| `In Progress` | Active work by Engineer |
| `In Review` | Code review phase |
| `Ready` | Design/spec done, awaiting next phase |
| `Done` | Completed and closed |
