# ROUTING RULES
# Maps issue labels to workflows
# =============================================================================
routing:
  # Feature development: Full workflow
  - trigger:
      labels: ["type:feature"]
      event: "opened"
    workflow: "feature-workflow"
    priority: 1

  # User stories: Full workflow
  - trigger:
      labels: ["type:story"]
      event: "opened"
    workflow: "feature-workflow"
    priority: 1

  # Bug fixes: Skip architect
  - trigger:
      labels: ["type:bug"]
      event: "opened"
    workflow: "bug-workflow"
    priority: 2

  # Spikes/Research: Architect only
  - trigger:
      labels: ["type:spike"]
      event: "opened"
    workflow: "spike-workflow"
    priority: 3

  # UX work: UX Designer first
  - trigger:
      labels: ["type:ux"]
      event: "opened"
    workflow: "ux-workflow"
    priority: 2

  # Documentation: Engineer only
  - trigger:
      labels: ["type:docs"]
      event: "opened"
    workflow: "docs-workflow"
    priority: 4

  # Refactoring: Full workflow
  - trigger:
      labels: ["type:refactor"]
      event: "opened"
    workflow: "feature-workflow"
    priority: 2

  # Security issues: Reviewer first
