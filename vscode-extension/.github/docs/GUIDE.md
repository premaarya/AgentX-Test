## 5-Minute Quickstart

> **Build your first feature with AgentX in 5 minutes.**

### What You'll Do

1. Install AgentX into your project
2. Create your first issue
3. Run the PM -> Engineer -> Reviewer pipeline
4. Ship a reviewed, tested feature

**Time**: ~5 minutes (with an existing project)

### Step 1: Install (30 seconds)

```powershell
# PowerShell -- into an existing project directory
cd your-project
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnPiyush/AgentX/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

```bash
# Bash
cd your-project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnPiyush/AgentX/master/install.sh | bash
```

**What happens**: AgentX copies agents, skills, templates, and CLI into your project. Your existing code is untouched.

> **No GitHub?** Add `-Local` (PowerShell) or `--local` (Bash) for offline mode.

### Step 2: Create Your First Issue (30 seconds)

Open VS Code with Copilot Chat. Type:

```
@agent-x Create a story to add a /health endpoint to our API
```

**Or via CLI** (GitHub mode):
```bash
gh issue create --title "[Story] Add /health endpoint" --label "type:story"
```

**Or via CLI** (Local mode):
```powershell
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action create -Title "[Story] Add /health endpoint" -Labels "type:story"
```

Agent X classifies this as a `type:story` (simple, <=3 files) and can complete it directly in the current session, using the Engineer workflow internally.

### Step 3: Implement with Agent X or Engineer (2 minutes)

Stay in **Agent X** for end-to-end execution, or switch to **Engineer** if you want strict manual role isolation:

```
@Engineer Implement the health endpoint for issue #1
```

The implementation workflow will:

1. **Read the issue** and check prerequisites
2. **Load the right skills** automatically (`api-design`, `testing`, `error-handling`)
3. **Generate code** that follows your project's instruction guardrails
4. **Write tests** (enforced: >=80% coverage)
5. **Commit** with proper format: `feat: add health endpoint (#1)`

#### What Guardrails Are Active?

| If you're editing... | Auto-loaded instruction | Enforces |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------|
| `*.py` | `python.instructions.md` | Type hints, PEP 8, Google docstrings |
| `*.cs` | `csharp.instructions.md` | Nullable types, async patterns, XML docs |
| `*.ts` | `typescript.instructions.md` | Strict mode, Zod validation, ESM imports |
| `*.tsx` | `react.instructions.md` | Hooks, TypeScript props, accessibility |

You don't configure this -- it's automatic via `applyTo` glob matching.

### Step 4: Review with Reviewer Agent (1 minute)

Once the Engineer moves the issue to `In Review`:

```
@Reviewer Review the code for issue #1
```

The Reviewer will:

1. **Check code quality** (naming, patterns, SOLID principles)
2. **Verify tests** (80% coverage, test pyramid)
3. **Security scan** (no hardcoded secrets, parameterized SQL)
4. **Create review doc** at `docs/artifacts/reviews/REVIEW-1.md`
5. **Approve** -> Status moves to `Done`

### Step 5: Done! What Just Happened?

AgentX enforced:
- **Code standards** via auto-loaded instruction files
- **Test coverage** (80%+ required by Engineer constraints)
- **Security** (blocked commands, secrets scanning)
- **Process** (issue-first, status tracking, review before merge)

### Next: Try a Complex Feature

For larger work, use the **full pipeline**:

```
@agent-x Create an epic for user authentication with OAuth
```

This triggers the full flow:

```
PM (creates PRD)
 -> UX Designer (wireframes + prototypes)
 -> Architect (ADR + Tech Spec)
 -> Engineer (implementation)
 -> Reviewer (code review)
```

Each agent produces a deliverable, validates it, and hands off to the next.

## Installation

### Quick Install

```powershell
# PowerShell (Windows)
.\install.ps1

# Bash (Linux/Mac)
./install.sh

# One-liner (downloads and runs)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnPiyush/AgentX/master/install.ps1 | iex    # PowerShell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnPiyush/AgentX/master/install.sh | bash  # Bash
```

PowerShell install path note:
`install.ps1` requires PowerShell 7.4+ (`pwsh`). If you are on older Windows PowerShell, install PowerShell 7 and rerun with `pwsh -File .\install.ps1`.

### Install Profiles

Control what gets installed with the `-Profile` flag:

| Profile | Skills | Instructions | Prompts | Hooks | VS Code |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|---------|
| **full** (default) | All 67 | All 7 | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **minimal** | None | None | No | No | No |
| **python** | Python, testing, data, architecture | python, api | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **dotnet** | C#, Blazor, Azure, SQL, architecture | csharp, blazor, api | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **react** | React, TypeScript, UI, design, architecture | react, api | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**All profiles always include**: agents, templates, CLI, instructions, issue templates, documentation.

```powershell
# PowerShell examples
.\install.ps1 -Profile python          # Python stack
.\install.ps1 -Profile minimal -Local  # Core only, local mode
.\install.ps1 -Force                   # Reinstall (overwrite existing)
.\install.ps1 -NoSetup                 # Skip interactive prompts (CI/scripts)

# Bash examples
./install.sh --profile python
./install.sh --profile minimal --local
./install.sh --force
./install.sh --no-setup

# One-liner with profile (env vars)
PROFILE=python curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnPiyush/AgentX/master/install.sh | bash
```

### What the Installer Does

1. **Download** -- Downloads the AgentX repo archive to a temp directory
2. **Extract** -- Unpacks the archive and identifies essential directories
3. **Copy** -- Merges files into your project (skips existing files unless `-Force`)
4. **Configure** -- Generates `agent-status.json`, `config.json`, output directories
5. **Setup** -- Interactive: git init, hooks install, username config (skip with `-NoSetup`)
6. **Companion Extensions** -- Installs Azure companion capabilities when AgentX detects an Azure-oriented workspace (or when you force it with `-Azure` / `--azure`)

---

## Companion Extensions

AgentX works with companion extensions that provide complementary capabilities. The installer auto-installs these when the `code` CLI is available.

| Extension | ID | Purpose | Auto-Installed |
|-----------|-----|---------|----------------|
| **Azure MCP Extension** | `ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-mcp-server` | Installs Azure MCP plus the Azure Skills companion for Azure design, deployment, diagnostics, and Foundry workflows | Azure workspaces only |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `GitHub.copilot` | AI code completions (required for Copilot Chat) | Prerequisite |
| **GitHub Copilot Chat** | `GitHub.copilot-chat` | Chat interface for agent interactions | Prerequisite |

### Why Azure MCP Extension and Azure Skills?

When a project targets Azure, AgentX can install the Azure MCP Extension. That extension also brings in the Azure Skills companion from `microsoft/azure-skills`, wiring the guidance layer and MCP execution layer together for Azure work.

| Layer | Provider | Covers |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Design and Architecture** | AgentX `azure-foundry` | Model selection, eval strategy, guardrails, deployment patterns |
| **Operational Execution** | Azure Skills plugin + Azure MCP | Prepare, validate, deploy, diagnose, cost review, RBAC, Foundry workflows |

AgentX triggers this install when it detects Azure files such as `azure.yaml`, `.azure/`, Azure Functions config, or Bicep files. You can also force it during install with `-Azure` on PowerShell or `--azure` on Bash.

### Manual Install

If the installer couldn't auto-install (no `code` CLI):

```bash
code --install-extension ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-mcp-server
```

### Workspace Recommendations

AgentX includes a `.vscode/extensions.json` that recommends companion extensions. VS Code will prompt users to install them when opening the workspace.

### Provider Configuration

AgentX now resolves runtime behavior from `.agentx/config.json` in this order:

1. `provider` (canonical)
2. `integration` (migration compatibility)
3. `mode` (legacy compatibility)

Use `provider` for new workspaces. Older fields are still read so existing repos continue to work.

---

## GitHub Project Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Project V2

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh project create --owner <OWNER> --title "AgentX Development"

# Or via web: https://github.com/users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/projects
```

### 2. Configure Status Field

In your project settings, create a **Status** field (Single Select) with these values:

| Status Value | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Backlog | Issue created, waiting to be claimed |
| Ready | Design/spec complete, awaiting next phase |
| In Progress | Active work by Engineer |
| In Review | Code review phase |
| Done | Completed and closed |

> **Status Tracking**: Use GitHub Projects V2 **Status** field, NOT labels. Labels are for type only (`type:epic`, `type:story`, etc.).

### 3. Link Repository

1. Go to Project Settings -> Manage Access
2. Add repository: `<OWNER>/<REPO>`
3. Issues automatically sync to project board

### 4. Configure AgentX CLI Status Sync

To let `agentx issue update -s ...` keep GitHub Project V2 status in sync, set these values in `.agentx/config.json`:

```json
{
  "provider": "github",
  "repo": "OWNER/REPO",
  "project": 4
}
```

Optional:
- `projectOwner`: override the project owner if it differs from the repo owner
- `githubProjectStatusMap`: override status-name mapping if your project uses custom option names

Default AgentX -> GitHub Project status mapping:

| AgentX Status | GitHub Project Status |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Backlog | Backlog |
| Ready | Ready |
| In Progress | In progress |
| In Review | In review |
| Validating | In review |
| Done | Done |

When a GitHub project number is configured, the CLI will:
- add newly created GitHub issues to that project
- set new issues to `Backlog`
- update Project V2 status when `agentx issue update -s ...` is used
- set Project V2 status to `Done` before `agentx issue close`

GitHub does not emit a normal workflow event when a Project V2 Status field changes. After moving an issue between Status values, rerun Agent X routing by adding an issue comment with exactly:

```text
/agentx route
```

The same router workflow also remains available through manual `workflow_dispatch` when needed.

When `.agentx/config.json` includes a GitHub project number, AgentX also ships a scheduled reroute poller workflow that scans recent Project V2 item changes and redispatches `agent-x.yml` automatically. Use `/agentx route` when you need an immediate reroute instead of waiting for the next scheduled scan.

### Status Transitions

| Phase | Status Transition | Meaning |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| PM completes PRD | -> `Ready` | Ready for design/architecture |
| UX completes designs | -> `Ready` | Ready for architecture |
| Architect completes spec | -> `Ready` | Ready for implementation |
| Engineer starts work | -> `In Progress` | Active development |
| Engineer completes code | -> `In Review` | Ready for code review |
| Reviewer approves | -> `Validating` | Ready for post-review validation |
| DevOps + Tester validate | -> `Done` + Close | Work complete (or back to Engineer for bug fixes) |

### Agent Workflow with Projects

```json
// Check issue status via MCP
{ "tool": "issue_read", "args": { "issue_number": 60 } }
```

Agents:
1. Check issue Status in Projects board
2. Comment when starting ("Engineer starting implementation...")
3. Complete work
4. Update Status in Projects board
5. Comment when done ("Implementation complete")

### Querying Issues

```bash
# By type
gh issue list --label "type:story"

# By label
gh issue list --label "needs:ux"

# Via MCP
{ "tool": "list_issues", "args": { "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "AgentX", "labels": ["type:story"], "state": "open" } }
```

### Ideal Issue-First Workflow (GitHub Mode)

Every piece of work starts with an issue. This gives agents a coordination point for routing, status tracking, and handoff validation.

```bash
# Step 1: Create issue BEFORE starting work
gh issue create --title "[Story] Add /health endpoint" \
  --label "type:story" --label "priority:p1" \
  --body "## Acceptance Criteria
- GET /health returns 200 with JSON body
- Response includes uptime and version
- Unit tests cover happy path and error cases

## Dependencies
None"

# Step 2: Check the ready queue for prioritized work
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 ready

# Step 3: Update status as work progresses
# If .agentx/config.json includes a GitHub project number, the CLI also syncs
# the Project V2 Status field for these transitions.
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 issue update -n 42 -s "In Progress"
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 issue update -n 42 -s "In Review"

# Step 4: Commit with issue reference
git commit -m "feat: add health endpoint (#42)"

# Step 5: After review, close the issue
gh issue close 42 --reason completed
```

**What agents get from the issue:**
- **Engineer**: Acceptance criteria, dependencies, priority
- **Reviewer**: Validation checklist, scope of changes
- **PM/Architect**: Context for PRD/ADR creation on complex issues
- **Agent X**: Classification data for routing decisions

**Emergency bypass**: Add `[skip-issue]` to the commit message for hotfixes. Create a retroactive issue afterward:
```bash
gh issue create --title "[Bug] Fix login timeout" --label "type:bug" \
  --body "Fixed in commit abc1234. Retroactive issue for traceability."
gh issue close <ID> --reason completed
```

### Recommended Board View

**Columns:** Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done
**Filters:** Group by Status, Sort by Priority (descending)

### GitHub Projects Troubleshooting

- **Status not visible**: Ensure issue is added to project and Status field exists
- **Agent coordination issues**: Verify Status field value in Projects board
- **Status changed but routing did not re-run**: Add the issue comment `/agentx route` to trigger an explicit status-based reroute
- **Automatic reroute still not happening**: Verify `.agentx/config.json` includes the GitHub project number and that the `Agent X Project Reroute Poller` workflow is enabled
- **Manual add**: `gh project item-add <PROJECT_ID> --owner <OWNER> --url <ISSUE_URL>`

---

## Local Mode (No GitHub)

Use AgentX without GitHub -- filesystem-based issue tracking and agent coordination.

### When to Use

Recommended: Personal projects, learning AgentX, offline development, prototyping
Not recommended: Team collaboration, CI/CD, code reviews, production workflows

### Installation

**During initial setup:**
```powershell
# PowerShell
.\install.ps1 -Local

# Bash
./install.sh --local
```

**With mode flag:**
```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Local
```

**Enable later (if already installed in GitHub mode):**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".agentx/issues" -Force

@{
  provider = "local"
  integration = "local"
    mode = "local"
    enforceIssues = $false
    nextIssueNumber = 1
    created = (Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ")
} | ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content ".agentx/config.json"
```

**Configure issue enforcement:**
```powershell
# Local mode: issues are optional by default
# Enable if you want commit-msg hook to require issue references:
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues true

# Disable again:
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues false
```

### Issue Management

```powershell
# Create issue
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action create `
    -Title "[Story] Add user login" `
    -Body "Implement user authentication" `
    -Labels "type:story"

# List all issues
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action list

# Get specific issue
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action get -IssueNumber 1

# Update status
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "In Progress"

# Add comment
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action comment -IssueNumber 1 -Comment "Started implementation"

# Close issue
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action close -IssueNumber 1
```

**Bash (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
./.agentx/local-issue-manager.sh create "[Story] Add user login" "Implement auth" "type:story"
./.agentx/local-issue-manager.sh list
```

**Optional alias** (add to `$PROFILE`):
```powershell
function issue { .\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 @args }
# Then: issue -Action create -Title "[Bug] Fix login" -Labels "type:bug"
```

### Workflow

```
1. Create Issue -> 2. Update Status -> 3. Write Code -> 4. Commit -> 5. Close Issue
```

### File Structure

```
.agentx/
  config.json                    # Provider configuration (`provider` is canonical)
  agentx.ps1                     # PowerShell CLI launcher
  agentx.sh                      # Bash CLI launcher
  agentx-cli.ps1                 # CLI implementation (all subcommands)
  agentic-runner.ps1             # LLM-powered agentic loop runner
  issues/
    1.json                       # Issue #1 data
    2.json                       # Issue #2 data
  state/
    agent-status.json            # Agent state tracking
  digests/                       # Weekly issue digests
  local-issue-manager.ps1        # PowerShell issue manager
  local-issue-manager.sh         # Bash issue manager
```

### AgentX CLI Commands

The CLI works across Local, GitHub, and ADO providers. It resolves the active platform from `.agentx/config.json`, preferring `provider` and falling back to legacy `integration` and `mode` fields.

```powershell
# PowerShell
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 ready                          # Show priority-sorted work queue
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 state                          # Show all agent states
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 state -a engineer -s working -i 42
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 deps 42                        # Check issue dependencies
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 digest                         # Generate weekly digest
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 workflow engineer              # Show workflow steps
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 hook -Phase start -Agent engineer -Issue 42
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 run engineer "Fix the tests"   # Run agentic loop (LLM + tools)
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config show                    # View current configuration
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 backlog-sync github --force    # Force re-sync local backlog to GitHub
```

```bash
# Bash
./.agentx/agentx.sh ready
./.agentx/agentx.sh state engineer working 42
./.agentx/agentx.sh deps 42
./.agentx/agentx.sh hook start engineer 42
./.agentx/agentx.sh run engineer "Fix the tests"
```

### Forced GitHub Backlog Re-Sync

If you want to re-apply the current local backlog state to GitHub after the initial migration, run:

```powershell
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 backlog-sync github --force
```

This reuses the stored local-to-remote issue mapping when available, updates remote issue title/body/labels, replays any new local comments that have not been migrated yet, and reapplies the latest local open/closed status plus GitHub Project V2 status.

### Issue JSON Format

```json
{
  "number": 1,
  "title": "[Story] Add logout button",
  "labels": ["type:story"],
  "status": "In Progress",
  "state": "open",
  "created": "2026-02-04T10:00:00Z",
  "comments": [
    { "body": "Started implementation", "created": "2026-02-04T11:30:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

### Ideal Issue-First Workflow (Local Mode)

In Local Mode, issue-first workflow is **optional by default** -- you can commit freely without issue references. Issue enforcement can be turned on if preferred via `enforceIssues` config.

```powershell
# Simple mode: just commit without issue references
git commit -m "feat: add user login"
git commit -m "fix: resolve timeout"

# Enable issue enforcement if you want it:
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues true

# Full issue workflow (optional but recommended for complex work):
# Step 1: Create issue BEFORE starting work
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action create `
    -Title "[Bug] Fix login timeout" `
    -Body "## Problem
Login times out after 30s on slow connections.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Increase timeout to 60s
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Unit tests for retry behavior" `
    -Labels "type:bug"
# -> Creates .agentx/issues/1.json

# Step 2: Check the ready queue for prioritized work
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 ready

# Step 3: Update status as you work
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "In Progress"
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action comment -IssueNumber 1 `
    -Comment "Started implementation - increasing timeout and adding retry"

# Step 4: Commit with issue reference
git commit -m "fix: resolve login timeout with retry logic (#1)"

# Step 5: Move to review, then close
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "In Review"
# After self-review or peer review:
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "Done"
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action close -IssueNumber 1
```

```bash
# Bash equivalent
./.agentx/local-issue-manager.sh create "[Bug] Fix login timeout" "Fix timeout issue" "type:bug"
./.agentx/agentx.sh ready
git commit -m "fix: resolve login timeout (#1)"
./.agentx/local-issue-manager.sh close 1
```

**Emergency bypass**: Add `[skip-issue]` to the commit message. Create a retroactive issue afterward:
```powershell
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action create `
    -Title "[Bug] Fix login timeout" `
    -Body "Fixed in commit abc1234. Retroactive issue for traceability." `
    -Labels "type:bug"
.\.agentx\local-issue-manager.ps1 -Action close -IssueNumber <ID>
```

### Agent Handoffs (Manual)

In Local Mode, coordination is manual:

```powershell
# PM -> Architect
issue -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "Ready"
issue -Action comment -IssueNumber 1 -Comment "PRD complete at docs/artifacts/prd/PRD-1.md"

# Architect -> Engineer
issue -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "In Progress"
# (Write code)
issue -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "In Review"

# Reviewer -> Done
issue -Action update -IssueNumber 1 -Status "Done"
issue -Action close -IssueNumber 1
```

### Limitations

| Missing Feature | Local Mode Alternative |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| GitHub Actions | Run scripts manually: `.github/scripts/validate-handoff.sh` |
| Pull Requests | Manual code review using `docs/artifacts/reviews/` |
| Projects Board | Track status in issue JSON files |
| Notifications | Manual check with `issue -Action list` |

### Migration to GitHub

```powershell
# 1. Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/owner/repo.git

# 2. Create labels
gh label create "type:epic" --color "5319E7"
gh label create "type:feature" --color "A2EEEF"
gh label create "type:story" --color "0E8A16"
gh label create "type:bug" --color "D73A4A"
gh label create "type:spike" --color "FBCA04"
gh label create "type:docs" --color "0075CA"

# 3. Trigger AgentX once after GitHub is available
# AgentX auto-detects the GitHub repo, switches provider, and syncs the full
# local backlog to GitHub with the latest local status.
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 config show

# 4. Push and verify config
git push -u origin master
Get-Content .agentx/config.json -Raw
```

What gets synced automatically:
- All local backlog items under `.agentx/issues`, not only open issues.
- Title, body, and labels for each local issue.
- Latest local workflow status into GitHub Project V2 when `project` is configured.
- Closed local items are closed remotely after migration.
- Local comments are copied into the GitHub issue as migrated comments.

If you prefer to switch explicitly before the first auto-detected command, set `repo` or `provider` in `.agentx/config.json` and the same full backlog sync will run on the next AgentX command.

### Azure DevOps Provider

Use the ADO provider when your team tracks work in Azure DevOps instead of GitHub issues.

Requirements:
- Azure CLI installed
- `azure-devops` CLI extension available
- `.agentx/config.json` contains `provider = "ado"`, `organization`, and `project`

Example config:

```json
{
  "provider": "ado",
  "integration": "ado",
  "organization": "myorg",
  "project": "MyProject",
  "created": "2026-03-08T12:00:00Z"
}
```

The same harness compliance script runs locally, in GitHub Actions, and in Azure Pipelines so plan/evidence checks stay aligned across providers.

## GitHub MCP Server Integration

Replace CLI-based GitHub operations with MCP Server for direct API access, eliminating `workflow_dispatch` caching issues.

### Benefits

- **Immediate workflow triggers** -- no cache refresh wait
- **Structured JSON responses** -- better for agent parsing
- **Unified tooling** -- issues, PRs, Actions in one interface

### Configuration

#### Option 1: Remote Server (Recommended)

No installation required. Requires VS Code 1.101+ and GitHub Copilot subscription.

```json
// .vscode/mcp.json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

OAuth is handled automatically -- no PAT needed.

#### Option 2: Native Binary (Local)

```bash
go install github.com/github/github-mcp-server@latest
```

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "github-mcp-server",
      "args": ["stdio"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}",
        "GITHUB_TOOLSETS": "actions,issues,pull_requests,repos,users,context"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Docker

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [

#### Comparison

| Aspect | Remote (Hosted) | Native Binary | Docker |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Setup | None | `go install` | Docker running |
| Auth | OAuth (auto) | PAT required | PAT required |
| Startup | Instant | Instant | Container delay |
| Maintenance | GitHub maintains | You update | You update |

### Available Toolsets

| Toolset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `actions` | Workflows and CI/CD operations |
| `issues` | Issue creation, updates, comments |
| `pull_requests` | PR management |
| `repos` | Repository operations |
| `users` | User information |
| `context` | Current user/repo context |

### Key Operations

**Trigger workflow:**
```json
{ "tool": "run_workflow", "args": {
    "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>",
    "workflow_id": "run-product-manager.yml",
    "ref": "master",
    "inputs": { "issue_number": "48" }
} }
```

**Create issue:**
```json
{ "tool": "create_issue", "args": {
    "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>",
    "title": "[Feature] New capability",
    "body": "## Description\n...",
    "labels": ["type:feature"]
} }
```

**Monitor workflows:**
```json
{ "tool": "list_workflow_runs", "args": {
    "owner": "<OWNER>", "repo": "<REPO>",
    "workflow_id": "run-product-manager.yml",
    "status": "in_progress"
} }
```

**Workflow control:** `cancel_workflow_run`, `rerun_workflow_run`, `rerun_failed_jobs`

### Agent Orchestration via MCP

```
1. PM completes -> Status = Ready -> UX/Architect picks up
2. Architect completes -> Status = Ready -> Engineer picks up
3. Engineer completes -> Status = In Review -> Reviewer picks up
4. Reviewer approves -> Status = Done + Close issue
```

### MCP vs CLI Comparison

| Aspect | GitHub CLI | GitHub MCP Server |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Caching | Subject to GitHub caching | Direct API (no cache) |
| Response | Text output | Structured JSON |
| Agent Integration | Parse stdout | Native tool calls |
| Concurrent Ops | Sequential | Can batch requests |

### MCP Troubleshooting

- **Docker not running**: Start Docker Desktop
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check PAT has `repo` and `workflow` scopes
- **Workflow not found**: Verify exact filename (e.g., `run-pm.yml` not `run-pm`)
- **Rate limited**: Wait for reset or use authenticated requests

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Pre-commit hooks not working | `cp .github/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit` |
| Permission denied on scripts | Linux/Mac: `chmod +x .github/scripts/*.sh`; Windows: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` |
| GitHub CLI not authenticated | `gh auth login` (install first: `winget install GitHub.cli` / `brew install gh`) |

### Workflow Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Issue reference required" error | In local mode: this is now off by default. In GitHub mode: include issue number `git commit -m "feat: add login (#123)"` or bypass with `[skip-issue]` |
| Issue enforcement in local mode | Toggle with `.agentx/agentx.ps1 config set enforceIssues true` (or `false`) |
| Status not updating | Verify GitHub Projects V2 (not V1), check Status field has correct values |
| Agent not triggering | Check Actions is enabled, verify workflow syntax, check Actions tab for failures |

### Validation Failures

| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| PRD missing sections | Ensure: Problem Statement, Target Users, Goals, Requirements, User Stories |
| ADR missing sections | Ensure: Context, Decision, Options Considered (3+), Consequences |
| Test coverage below 80% | Run `dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true` or `pytest --cov=src`, add more tests |

### Local Mode Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Local issues not creating | Run: `mkdir .agentx/issues -Force` then init config |
| Switching Local to GitHub | Add remote: `git remote add origin <url>`, then run an AgentX command to auto-switch provider and sync the full local backlog |

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | Run `validate-handoff.sh <issue> <role>` to see details |
| `STATUS_NOT_READY` | Wait for previous agent to finish |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | `chmod +x script.sh` |
| `GH_AUTH_REQUIRED` | `gh auth login` |
| `ISSUE_NOT_FOUND` | Verify issue number exists |

### Debug Commands

```bash
gh run list --limit 5            # Recent workflow runs
gh run view <run-id> --log       # Specific run logs
DEBUG=1 ./validate-handoff.sh 123 engineer  # Debug mode
```
