### Quick Example

```
@workspace /agent-x Create an Epic for user authentication with OAuth2
```

AgentX will:
1. Route to **Product Manager** → Create PRD
2. Route to **Architect**, **Data Scientist**, and **UX Designer** in parallel
3. Route to **Engineer** → Implement code and tests
4. Route to **Reviewer** → Review and approve
5. Route to **DevOps** and **Tester** in parallel for post-review validation
