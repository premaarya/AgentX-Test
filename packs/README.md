# AgentX Packs

Packs are distributable bundles of AgentX artifacts (agents, instructions, skills, templates, workflows) that can be selectively installed into any project.

## What is a Pack?

A pack is a `manifest.json` file that declares which artifacts belong together. Packs enable:

- **Modular distribution** -- install only what you need
- **Versioned bundles** -- track which version of each pack is installed
- **Dependency management** -- packs can depend on other packs
- **Selective updates** -- update one pack without affecting others

## Pack Structure

```
packs/
  agentx-core/
    manifest.json     # Core SDLC agents + instructions + workflows
  agentx-ai/
    manifest.json     # AI/ML specific agents + skills (future)
  agentx-cloud/
    manifest.json     # Cloud infrastructure skills (future)
```

## Manifest Schema

Each pack has a `manifest.json` validated against `.github/schemas/pack-manifest.schema.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "agentx-core",
  "version": "5.3.0",
  "description": "Core SDLC agents and workflow engine.",
