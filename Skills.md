# Production Code Skills & Technical Guidelines

> **Purpose**: Production-ready guidelines for agents to build secure, scalable, maintainable systems.  
> **Usage**: Index for detailed skill documents. Read relevant skills before implementation.  
> **Standard**: Follows [github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) skills specification from [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification).  
> **Structure**: Each skill uses progressive disclosure — metadata (~100 tokens) → SKILL.md body (<5K) → references/ (on demand) → assets/ (templates, starter code).

## Skill Structure & Progressive Disclosure

Each skill follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) specification with progressive loading:

```
.github/skills/{category}/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md               # Main document (< 500 lines, loaded on activation)
├── scripts/               # Executable automation (optional)
│   └── *.ps1              # PowerShell scripts for scanning, scaffolding, etc.
├── references/            # Extended content (optional, loaded on demand)
│   └── *.md               # Detailed examples, templates, patterns
└── assets/                # Static resources (optional)
```

**Token Budget**:
| Level | Loads When | Token Budget |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Frontmatter | Always (discovery) | ~100 tokens |
| SKILL.md body | On skill activation | < 5,000 tokens |
| references/ | On-demand via `read_file` | Variable |

**Available Scripts**:
| Script | Skill | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `check-coverage.ps1` | Testing | Auto-detect project type, run coverage, check 80% threshold |
| `check-test-pyramid.ps1` | Testing | Validate test file ratios against 70/20/10 pyramid |
| `scan-security.ps1` | Security | Scan for SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, insecure patterns |
| `scan-secrets.ps1` | Security | Detect private keys, tokens, high-entropy strings |
| `version-bump.ps1` | Release Management | SemVer version bump for Node/.NET/Python projects |
| `init-skill.ps1` | Skill Creator | Scaffold new skill with proper frontmatter and structure |

**Creating New Skills**: Use `init-skill.ps1` or see [#37 Skill Creator](.github/skills/ai-systems/skill-creator/SKILL.md).

## Critical Production Rules

### Security (Always Enforce)
- ✅ Validate/sanitize ALL inputs → [#04](.github/skills/architecture/security/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Parameterize SQL queries (NEVER concatenate) → [#04](.github/skills/architecture/security/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Store secrets in env vars/Key Vault (NEVER hardcode) → [#10](.github/skills/development/configuration/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Implement authentication & authorization → [#04](.github/skills/architecture/security/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Use HTTPS everywhere in production
- ✅ Follow command allowlist (see `.github/security/allowed-commands.json`)

#### Defense-in-Depth Security Model

AgentX implements a **4-layer security architecture** inspired by enterprise security practices:

| Layer | Purpose | Enforcement | Status |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Level 1: Sandbox** | OS-level isolation | Container or VM boundary | Recommended |
| **Level 2: Filesystem** | Path restrictions | Operations limited to project directory | Active |
| **Level 3: Allowlist** | Command validation | Pre-execution hook checks against allowlist | Active |
| **Level 4: Audit** | Command logging | All commands logged with timestamps | Active |

**Command Allowlist**: See `.github/security/allowed-commands.json` for allowed operations by category (git, dotnet, npm, database, etc.).

**Blocked Commands**: `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `DROP DATABASE`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `format`, `del /s`

**Enforcement Points**:
1. **Pre-commit hook** - `.github/hooks/pre-commit` checks for blocked commands in staged files
2. **Runtime validation** - Agents validate commands before execution with `run_in_terminal`
3. **Audit logging** - All terminal commands logged to `.github/security/audit.log`

For complete details, see [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md#session-persistence--auto-resume).

### Quality (Non-Negotiable)
- ✅ 80%+ code coverage with tests → [#02](.github/skills/development/testing/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Test pyramid: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e → [#02](.github/skills/development/testing/SKILL.md)
- ✅ XML docs for all public APIs → [#11](.github/skills/development/documentation/SKILL.md)
- ✅ No compiler warnings or linter errors
- ✅ Code reviews before merge

### Operations (Production-Ready)
- ✅ Structured logging with correlation IDs → [#15](.github/skills/development/logging-monitoring/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Health checks (liveness + readiness) → [↓](#health-checks)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling → [↓](#graceful-shutdown)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with automated tests → [#16](.github/skills/operations/remote-git-operations/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Rollback strategy documented

### AI Agents (When Building AI Systems)
- ✅ Use Microsoft Foundry for production → [#17](.github/skills/ai-systems/ai-agent-development/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Enable OpenTelemetry tracing → [#17](.github/skills/ai-systems/ai-agent-development/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Evaluate with test datasets before deployment → [#17](.github/skills/ai-systems/ai-agent-development/SKILL.md)
- ✅ Monitor token usage and costs

---

## Health Checks

```csharp
// ASP.NET Core - Minimal Implementation
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddNpgSql(connectionString, name: "database")
    .AddRedis(redisConnection, name: "cache");

app.MapHealthChecks("/health/live", new() { Predicate = _ => false });
app.MapHealthChecks("/health/ready", new() { Predicate = c => c.Tags.Contains("ready") });
```

---

## Graceful Shutdown

```csharp
// ASP.NET Core - 30 second drain window
builder.Host.ConfigureHostOptions(opts => opts.ShutdownTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
```

---

## Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Rolling** | Zero-downtime updates, gradual rollout |
| **Blue-Green** | Instant rollback needed, identical environments |
| **Canary** | Risk mitigation, gradual traffic shift (5% → 100%) |
