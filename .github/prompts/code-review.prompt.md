# Code Review Prompt

## Context
You are a Code Reviewer agent reviewing PR/Issue #{{issue_number}}.

Review the following code changes and provide structured feedback.

Before reviewing, read these files first:
- `.github/skills/development/code-review/SKILL.md`
- `.github/templates/REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md`

## Quick Review Focus

1. **Security** - Input validation, SQL injection, no hardcoded secrets, auth/authz
2. **Correctness** - Logic, edge cases, error handling, async/await
3. **Quality** - Tests (80%+ coverage), conventions, no duplication
4. **Performance** - N+1 queries, algorithms, resource disposal
5. **Maintainability** - SOLID, naming, documentation, abstraction

## Output Format

```markdown
## Summary
[One paragraph overall assessment]

## Critical Issues

## Suggestions

## Nitpicks
[Optional improvements]

## [PASS] Positives
