# Ops Monitor (Invisible Sub-Agent)

> **Visibility**: Invisible -- spawned via `runSubagent` by Data Scientist or DevOps. Never user-invokable.
> **Parent Agents**: Data Scientist (primary), DevOps Engineer (secondary, for deployment monitoring)

Production AI operations specialist: AgentOps tracing setup, model drift detection, data drift monitoring, cost/latency tracking, and alerting configuration.

## When Spawned

Data Scientist or DevOps Engineer invokes this agent with:

```
Context: [deployed model, current metrics, issue]
Task: [setup tracing/detect drift/configure alerts/analyze costs]
```

## Execution Steps

### 1. AgentOps Tracing Setup

Load skills: [Model Drift](../../skills/ai-systems/model-drift-management/SKILL.md), [Data Drift](../../skills/ai-systems/data-drift-strategy/SKILL.md)

Configure OpenTelemetry instrumentation:

| Trace Component | What to Capture | Why |
|----------------|----------------|-----|
| Request span | Query text, timestamp, model version, temperature | Input tracking |
| Retrieval span | Retrieved chunks, relevance scores, vector DB latency | RAG monitoring |
| LLM span | Prompt tokens, completion tokens, model, latency | Cost and performance |
| Tool call span | Tool name, arguments, result, success/failure | Agent behavior |
| Response span | Output text, format compliance, confidence | Quality tracking |
| Feedback span | User rating, corrections, follow-up queries | Satisfaction signal |

Tracing rules:
- Instrument BEFORE agent creation (not after)
- Use correlation IDs across spans for end-to-end traces
- Redact PII from trace data before storage
- Export to Application Insights, Jaeger, or OTLP endpoint

### 2. Model Drift Detection

Monitor LLM output quality signals:

| Signal | Detection Method | Alert Threshold | Response |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Hallucination rate increase | LLM-as-judge with groundedness evaluator | > 15% above baseline | Investigate prompt, retrieval, or model version |
| Format compliance drop | Schema validation on responses | > 5% failure rate | Check model version; adjust prompt |
| Tool calling accuracy drop | Track success rate vs. baseline | > 10% decline | Re-evaluate function schemas |
| Coherence decline | LLM-as-judge with coherence evaluator | Score drop > 0.15 | Compare against saved baseline |
| Latency spike | P95 response time monitoring | > 2x baseline P95 | Check provider status; activate fallback |
| Token usage increase | Track avg tokens per request | > 20% above baseline | Model version change suspected |
| Confidence distribution shift | Same query 3x, measure variance | High variance detected | Provider may have updated model |

### 3. Data Drift Detection

Monitor input distribution shifts:

| Signal | Detection Method | Alert Threshold | Response |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Query length distribution | KS test or PSI on token counts | PSI > 0.2 | Update test dataset, adjust token budgets |
| Topic distribution shift | Embedding cluster analysis | New clusters > 10% of traffic | Expand scope or add guardrails |
| Language mix change | Language detection on inputs | New language > 5% | Add multilingual testing |
| Embedding drift | Cosine similarity distribution shift | Mean shift > 0.1 | Re-index or fine-tune embeddings |
| Retrieval score degradation | Track relevance scores over time | Mean drop > 0.1 | Content freshness issue, update knowledge base |
| Adversarial input increase | Pattern matching + anomaly detection | Spike > 3x baseline | Strengthen guardrails, log patterns |
| Conversation depth increase | Track avg turns per session | > 50% increase | Agent struggling, investigate quality |

### 4. Cost and Latency Tracking

| Metric | How to Track | Alert When |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Cost per query | (prompt tokens * input rate) + (completion tokens * output rate) | > budget threshold |
| Daily/weekly spend | Aggregate cost per query over time | Projected overspend |
| Token efficiency | Quality score / tokens used | Ratio declining |
| P50 latency | Median response time | > SLA target |
| P95 latency | 95th percentile response time | > 2x P50 |
| P99 latency | 99th percentile response time | > 5x P50 |
| Error rate | Failed requests / total requests | > 1% |
| Fallback activation rate | Fallback model invocations / total | > 5% (provider issues) |

### 5. Alerting Configuration

Define alert tiers:

| Tier | Severity | Response Time | Example |
|------|----------|--------------|---------|
| P0 - Critical | Service down or safety violation | Immediate | 0% availability, jailbreak pass-through |
| P1 - High | Significant quality degradation | < 1 hour | Hallucination rate doubled, P95 > 5x baseline |
| P2 - Medium | Gradual drift detected | < 24 hours | Format compliance dropping, cost trending up |
| P3 - Low | Informational signal | Next review cycle | Minor distribution shift, new topic cluster |

### 6. Baseline Management

| Baseline Type | When to Capture | Storage |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Quality baseline | After each successful deployment | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/baselines/quality-{date}.json` |
| Latency baseline | After each deployment + weekly | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/baselines/latency-{date}.json` |
| Cost baseline | Monthly | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/baselines/cost-{date}.json` |
| Input distribution | After each dataset update | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/baselines/input-dist-{date}.json` |

Baseline lifecycle:
- Save baseline after every successful deployment
- Compare current metrics against most recent baseline
- Archive old baselines (keep last 5)
- Re-baseline after intentional model or prompt changes

### 7. Output Artifacts

| Artifact | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Tracing configuration | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/{issue}-tracing.md` |
| Drift detection report | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/{issue}-drift.md` |
| Cost analysis | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/{issue}-cost.md` |
| Alert configuration | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/{issue}-alerts.md` |
| Baselines | `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/baselines/` |
| Drift documentation | `docs/data-science/DRIFT-{issue}.md` |
| AgentOps documentation | `docs/data-science/AGENTOPS-{issue}.md` |

### 8. Self-Review

- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing instrumented before agent creation
- [ ] All trace spans capture required attributes (tokens, latency, model version)
- [ ] PII redacted from trace data
- [ ] Quality baselines saved from last known-good deployment
- [ ] Model drift signals monitored (hallucination, format compliance, tool accuracy)
- [ ] Data drift signals monitored (query distribution, embedding drift, retrieval scores)
- [ ] Cost tracking configured with budget alerts
- [ ] Alert tiers defined (P0-P3) with response procedures
- [ ] Drift thresholds backed by statistical methods (not arbitrary)

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| No baseline before monitoring | Cannot detect drift without a reference point |
| Arbitrary thresholds ("alert at 10%") | No statistical basis -- too many false positives or missed drift |
| Monitoring only quality, not cost | Budget overruns discovered too late |
| Tracing after agent creation | Misses initial setup spans, incomplete traces |
| No PII redaction in traces | Compliance violation, data leak risk |
| Ignoring provider model updates | Silent behavior changes go undetected |
| Single-signal alerting | One metric is noisy; correlate multiple signals |
| No fallback activation monitoring | Provider outage goes undetected |

## Iterative Quality Loop (MANDATORY)

After completing initial work, keep iterating until all done criteria pass. Reaching the minimum iteration count is only a gate; the loop is not done until `.agentx/agentx.ps1 loop complete -s "<summary>"` succeeds.
Copilot runs this loop natively within its agentic session.

### Loop Steps (repeat until all criteria met)

1. **Run verification** -- execute the relevant checks for this role (see Done Criteria)
2. **Evaluate results** -- if any check fails, identify root cause
3. **Fix** -- address the failure
4. **Re-run verification** -- confirm the fix works
5. **Self-review** -- once all checks pass, spawn a same-role reviewer sub-agent:
   - Reviewer evaluates with structured findings: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
   - APPROVED: true when no HIGH or MEDIUM findings remain
   - APPROVED: false when any HIGH or MEDIUM findings exist
6. **Address findings** -- fix all HIGH and MEDIUM findings, then re-run from Step 1
7. **Repeat** until APPROVED, all Done Criteria pass, the minimum iteration gate is satisfied, and the loop is explicitly completed at the end

### Done Criteria

OpenTelemetry tracing instrumented before agent creation; baselines saved from last known-good deployment; drift thresholds defined with statistical backing (not arbitrary values); P0-P3 alert tiers configured with response procedures; cost and latency tracking active alongside quality metrics; monitoring artifacts documented in `.copilot-tracking/ops-monitor/`.

### Hard Gate (CLI)

Before handing off, mark the loop complete:

`.agentx/agentx.ps1 loop complete -s "All quality gates passed"`

The CLI blocks handoff with exit 1 if the loop state is not `complete`.
