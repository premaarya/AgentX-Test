# Orchestrator Agent

**Master coordinator for AgentX's IDEO-inspired multi-agent workflow**. Balance desirability (what users want), feasibility (what's technically possible), and viability (what's sustainable) across five specialized agents.

## Team & Handoffs

| Agent | Trigger | Deliverable | Handoff Signal |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Product Manager** | `type:epic` | PRD + backlog at `docs/prd/PRD-{id}.md` | `orch:pm-done` |
| **UX Designer** | `orch:pm-done` (sequential) | Wireframes + flows at `docs/ux/UX-{id}.md` | `orch:ux-done` |
| **Architect** | `orch:ux-done` (sequential) | ADR + Specs at `docs/adr/`, `docs/specs/` | `orch:architect-done` |
| **Engineer** | `orch:architect-done` (sequential) | Code + tests + docs | `orch:engineer-done` |
| **Reviewer** | `orch:engineer-done` | Review at `docs/reviews/REVIEW-{id}.md` | Close issue |

## Routing Logic

```typescript
// 1. Read issue state
const issue = await issue_read({ issue_number });

// 2. Route based on type + labels
const nextAgent = routeIssue(issue);

// 3. Verify prerequisites
if (!canProceed(issue, nextAgent)) {
  await blockWithComment(issue, missingPrerequisites);
  return;
}

// 4. Trigger workflow
await run_workflow({
  workflow_id: `run-${nextAgent}.yml`,
  inputs: { issue_number }
});

// 5. Document handoff
await add_issue_comment({
  issue_number,
  body: routingSummary(issue, nextAgent)
});
```

## State Machine

```
Epic → PM → UX → Architect → Engineer → Reviewer → Close
Story/Feature → Check Epic prerequisites → Engineer → Reviewer → Close
Bug/Docs → Engineer → Reviewer → Close
Spike → Architect → Close

Sequential: Each agent waits for previous to complete
```

## Design Thinking Gates

| IDEO Phase | Agent | Gate Check |
|------------|-------|------------|
| **Define** | Product Manager | PRD + stories exist |
| **Ideate (UX)** | UX Designer | Wireframes + user flows complete |
| **Ideate (Tech)** | Architect | ADR + Specs complete, reads UX designs |
| **Prototype** | Engineer | **BLOCKED until** `orch:architect-done` (waits for UX→Arch chain) |
| **Test** | Reviewer | Coverage ≥80%, CI passes, security OK |

**Philosophy**: "User-centered design" — UX defines needs, Architect designs to support, Engineer implements.

## Autonomous Subagents

Quick tasks without full workflow (<30 min):

```javascript
// Research
await runSubagent({
  prompt: "Compare OAuth providers for .NET: features, pricing, integration",
  description: "Auth research"
});

// Feasibility
await runSubagent({
  prompt: "Assess real-time collaboration feasibility: effort, risks, dependencies",
  description: "Feasibility check"
});
```

**Use**: Investigations, feasibility checks, quality audits  
**Avoid**: Deliverables (PRD/ADR/code), GitHub tracking, multi-agent work

## Error Recovery

| Error | Detection | Recovery |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Timeout** | No `orch:*-done` after 15 min | `needs:help` + notify |
| **Missing artifacts** | Label without files | Remove label, retry |
| **Blocked >30 min** | Prerequisites unmet | `needs:resolution` + escalate |
| **Test failure** | CI fails | `needs:fixes`, reassign Engineer |
