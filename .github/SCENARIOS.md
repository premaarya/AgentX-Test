# Workflow Scenarios

> **Purpose**: Predefined multi-skill chains for common project scenarios.  
> **Usage**: When a task spans multiple skills or agents, match it to a scenario below and follow the chain in order.  
> **Relationship**: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) defines agent roles and handoffs. [Skills.md](../Skills.md) indexes individual skills. This file chains them into end-to-end workflows.

---

## How to Use

1. **Match** the user's request to a scenario below
2. **Load** each skill in the chain sequentially (not all at once)
3. **Complete** one skill's work before loading the next
4. **Pass context** explicitly between skills (file paths, decisions, outputs)

**Rules:**
- Skills remain independent — no cross-references between them
- Skip a skill in the chain if already satisfied (e.g., UX exists, skip `ux-ui-design`)
- Agent X routes to the correct starting point based on what's already done

## Checkpoint Protocol

When executing a scenario chain with 5+ skills, or when a single skill involves multi-phase work (>3 files changed), use checkpoints to prevent context rot and catch issues early.

### When to Use Checkpoints

| Condition | Use Checkpoints? |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Scenario chain ≤ 3 skills | ❌ Optional |
| Scenario chain 4-6 skills | ✅ At each skill boundary |
| Scenario chain 7+ skills | ✅ At each skill boundary + mid-skill |
| Single skill, ≤ 3 files changed | ❌ Not needed |
| Single skill, 4-10 files changed | ✅ After each major file group |
| Single skill, 10+ files changed | ✅ Every 3-5 files |

### Checkpoint Behavior

When a checkpoint is reached:

1. **Commit** current work (atomic, with issue reference)
2. **Summarize** what was completed and what remains
3. **Verify** tests pass, no regressions
4. **Present** status to user with options:
   - Continue to next skill/phase
   - Review current work before proceeding
   - Adjust plan based on findings
5. **Log** checkpoint in progress log (if issue has one)
6. **Wait** for user confirmation before proceeding

### Checkpoint Format

```markdown
## Checkpoint: [Skill Name] Complete

**Completed:**
- [List of deliverables produced]
- [Files created/modified]
- [Tests passing: X/Y]

**Next Up:** [Next skill in chain]
**Estimated Work:** [Brief scope description]

**Options:**
A) Continue to [next skill]
B) Review current changes first
C) Adjust plan
```

### Risk-Based Autonomy

Not all operations need user approval. Classify each step:

| Risk Level | Agent Behavior | Examples |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Low** | Apply autonomously | Formatting, imports, renaming, adding types |
| **Medium** | Apply + notify user | New files, test additions, config changes |
| **High** | Propose + wait for approval | Architecture changes, API contract changes, deletions |
