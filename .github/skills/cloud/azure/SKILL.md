# Azure Cloud Development

> **Purpose**: Best practices for developing and deploying applications on Microsoft Azure, including compute, storage, security, and DevOps.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Deploying applications to Microsoft Azure
- Configuring Azure compute, storage, or database services
- Setting up Azure networking and security
- Implementing CI/CD with Azure DevOps
- Managing Azure costs and monitoring

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed
- Basic cloud computing concepts

## Azure Fundamentals

### Resource Hierarchy

```
Management Group
└── Subscription
    └── Resource Group
        └── Resources (VMs, Storage, etc.)
```

### Naming Conventions

```
{resource-type}-{workload}-{environment}-{region}-{instance}

Examples:
vm-web-prod-eastus-001
st-data-dev-westus-001
sql-orders-staging-northeu-001
```

### Resource Groups

- Group resources by lifecycle
- One resource group per environment per application
- Apply tags for cost allocation and management

```bash
# Create resource group
az group create --name rg-myapp-prod --location eastus --tags Environment=Production Team=Engineering
```

---

## AI Services

### Azure OpenAI Service
- **Purpose**: LLM hosting (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-Turbo).
- **Best Practice**: Use **Managed Identity** for authentication. Disable keys.
- **Networking**: Deploy in Virtual Network with Private Endpoint.

```bash
# Create OpenAI Resource
az cognitiveservices account create \
  --name "ai-agentx-dev" \
  --resource-group "rg-agentx-dev-eastus-001" \
  --location "eastus2" \
  --kind "OpenAI" \
  --sku "S0"
```

### Azure AI Search
- **Purpose**: Vector database and retrieval engine for RAG.
- **Configuration**: Standard Tier required for Semantic Search.
- **RBAC**: Assign `Search Index Data Contributor` to the Agent Identity.

### Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL)
- **Purpose**: Conversation history and agent state.
- **Feature**: Use **Vector Indexing** for memory retrieval.
- **Consistency**: Session consistency is usually sufficient for chat.

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Use Managed Identity instead of connection strings
- Enable Azure Defender for security
- Use availability zones for high availability
- Implement proper tagging strategy
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform)
- Enable diagnostic logging
- Use Private Endpoints for PaaS services
- Implement proper backup and DR strategy

### ❌ DON'T

- Store secrets in code or config files
- Use overly permissive network rules
- Ignore Azure Advisor recommendations
- Skip resource locks on production resources
- Use public endpoints for databases
- Forget to set up cost alerts

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Deployment fails with permission error | Check Azure RBAC role assignments and service principal permissions |
| High Azure costs | Use Azure Cost Management, enable auto-shutdown for dev VMs, right-size resources |
| Resource not found errors | Verify resource group, subscription, and region are correct |
