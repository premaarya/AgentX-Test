# Improvement Loop Reference

> Quantitative scoring loop layered on top of the existing Iterative Quality Loop.
> Agents iterate until their deliverable scores Medium-High or above.

## Loop Steps

1. **Produce** - Agent creates initial deliverable (PRD, ADR, code, etc.)
2. **Score** - Run `scripts/score-output.ps1 -Role <role> -IssueNumber <n>`
3. **Evaluate** - Check tier: High (90%+), Medium-High (70-89%), Medium (50-69%), Low (<50%)
4. **Gate** - If tier >= Medium-High, proceed to Step 9. Otherwise continue.
5. **Diagnose** - Read individual check results to identify failing criteria
6. **Fix** - Address the highest-point failing check first
7. **Re-score** - Run score-output.ps1 again
8. **Repeat** - Loop Steps 5-7 until tier >= Medium-High (max 5 iterations)
9. **Self-review** - Agent evaluates with [HIGH]/[MEDIUM]/[LOW] findings
10. **Address** - Fix all HIGH and MEDIUM findings
11. **Final score** - Run score-output.ps1 one last time to confirm
12. **Handoff** - Mark loop complete via CLI: `.agentx/agentx.ps1 loop complete <issue>`

## Integration with CLI

```powershell
# Score after implementation
.\scripts\score-output.ps1 -Role engineer -IssueNumber 42

# Score exits 0 for Medium-High+, 1 otherwise
# CLI blocks handoff if loop not complete
.\.agentx\agentx.ps1 loop complete 42
```
