# Retry Logic & Circuit Breaker Patterns

## Retry Logic

### When to Retry

**Retry on:**
- Network failures (timeout, connection refused)
- Rate limiting (429 Too Many Requests)
- Service temporarily unavailable (503)
- Database deadlocks

**Don't retry on:**
- Validation errors (400 Bad Request)
- Authentication failures (401 Unauthorized)
- Not found errors (404)
- Permanent failures

### Retry Strategies

**Fixed Delay:**
```
function retryWithFixedDelay(operation, maxAttempts, delayMs):
    for attempt in 1 to maxAttempts:
        try:
            return operation()
        catch RetryableException as error:
            if attempt == maxAttempts:
                throw error
            sleep(delayMs)
```

**Exponential Backoff:**
```
function retryWithExponentialBackoff(operation, maxAttempts, baseDelayMs):
    for attempt in 1 to maxAttempts:
        try:
            return operation()
        catch RetryableException as error:
            if attempt == maxAttempts:
                throw error
            
            # Exponential delay: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms...
            delayMs = baseDelayMs * (2 ^ (attempt - 1))
            
            # Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
            jitterMs = random(0, delayMs * 0.1)
            sleep(delayMs + jitterMs)
```

**Retry with Timeout:**
```
function retryWithTimeout(operation, maxAttempts, timeoutMs):
    startTime = currentTime()
    
    for attempt in 1 to maxAttempts:
        # Check if total time exceeded
        if (currentTime() - startTime) > timeoutMs:
            throw TimeoutException("Operation timed out after " + timeoutMs + "ms")
        
        try:
            return operation()
        catch RetryableException as error:
            if attempt == maxAttempts:
                throw error
            sleep(calculateDelay(attempt))
```

**Retry Libraries:**
- **.NET**: Polly, Microsoft.Extensions.Resilience
- **Python**: tenacity, backoff
- **Node.js**: async-retry, retry
- **Java**: Resilience4j, Failsafe
- **Go**: go-retry

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Circuit Breaker States

```
States:
  CLOSED     - Normal operation, requests pass through
  OPEN       - Too many failures, requests fail immediately
  HALF_OPEN  - Testing if service recovered
  
State Transitions:
  CLOSED → OPEN: After failure threshold reached
  OPEN → HALF_OPEN: After timeout period
  HALF_OPEN → CLOSED: If test request succeeds
  HALF_OPEN → OPEN: If test request fails
```

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

```
class CircuitBreaker:
    state = CLOSED
    failureCount = 0
    lastFailureTime = null
    
    # Configuration
    failureThreshold = 5       # Open after 5 failures
    openTimeout = 60000        # Try again after 60 seconds
    halfOpenMaxRequests = 3    # Allow 3 test requests
    
    function execute(operation):
        if state == OPEN:
            if (currentTime() - lastFailureTime) > openTimeout:
                state = HALF_OPEN
            else:
                throw CircuitBreakerOpenException("Circuit breaker is OPEN")
        
        try:
            result = operation()
            onSuccess()
            return result
        catch error:
            onFailure()
            throw error
    
    function onSuccess():
        failureCount = 0
        if state == HALF_OPEN:
            state = CLOSED
    
    function onFailure():
        failureCount++
        lastFailureTime = currentTime()
        
        if failureCount >= failureThreshold:
            state = OPEN
```

**Circuit Breaker Usage:**
```
paymentCircuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({
    failureThreshold: 5,
    openTimeout: 60000
})

function processPayment(amount):
    return paymentCircuitBreaker.execute(() => {
        return paymentGateway.charge(amount)
    })
```
