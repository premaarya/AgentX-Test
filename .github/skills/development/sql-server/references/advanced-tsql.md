# Advanced T-SQL: Window Functions, CTEs, MERGE & Diagnostics

## Window Functions

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Row numbering
SELECT 
    Name,
    Category,
    Price,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS RowNum
FROM Products;

-- ✅ GOOD: Ranking
SELECT 
    Name,
    Score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS Rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS DenseRank,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS Quartile
FROM Students;

-- ✅ GOOD: Running totals
SELECT 
    OrderDate,
    Amount,
    SUM(Amount) OVER (ORDER BY OrderDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM Orders;

-- ✅ GOOD: Moving average
SELECT 
    Date,
    Value,
    AVG(Value) OVER (
        ORDER BY Date
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS MovingAvg7Day
FROM Metrics;

-- ✅ GOOD: Lag and Lead
SELECT 
    Date,
    Price,
    LAG(Price, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS PreviousPrice,
    LEAD(Price, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS NextPrice,
    Price - LAG(Price, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS PriceChange
FROM StockPrices;
```

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Recursive CTE
WITH CategoryHierarchy AS (
    -- Anchor: Root categories
    SELECT 
        Id,
        Name,
        ParentId,
        1 AS Level,
        CAST(Name AS NVARCHAR(MAX)) AS Path
    FROM Categories
    WHERE ParentId IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive: Child categories
    SELECT 
        c.Id,
        c.Name,
        c.ParentId,
        ch.Level + 1,
        CAST(ch.Path + ' > ' + c.Name AS NVARCHAR(MAX))
    FROM Categories c
    INNER JOIN CategoryHierarchy ch ON c.ParentId = ch.Id
)
SELECT * FROM CategoryHierarchy
ORDER BY Path;

-- ✅ GOOD: Multiple CTEs
WITH ActiveUsers AS (
    SELECT Id, Name FROM Users WHERE IsActive = 1
),
RecentOrders AS (
    SELECT 
        UserId,
        COUNT(*) AS OrderCount,
        SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
    FROM Orders
    WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, SYSDATETIME())
    GROUP BY UserId
)
SELECT 
    u.Name,
    ISNULL(ro.OrderCount, 0) AS RecentOrders,
    ISNULL(ro.TotalSpent, 0) AS TotalSpent
FROM ActiveUsers u
LEFT JOIN RecentOrders ro ON u.Id = ro.UserId
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;
```

## MERGE Statement (Upsert)

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: MERGE for upsert operations
MERGE INTO Users AS target
USING (
    SELECT 'john@example.com' AS Email, 'John Doe' AS Name
) AS source
ON target.Email = source.Email
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET 
        Name = source.Name,
        UpdatedAt = SYSDATETIME()
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (Email, Name, CreatedAt)
    VALUES (source.Email, source.Name, SYSDATETIME());

-- ✅ GOOD: MERGE with DELETE
MERGE INTO Inventory AS target
USING StagingInventory AS source
ON target.ProductId = source.ProductId
WHEN MATCHED AND source.Quantity > 0 THEN
    UPDATE SET Quantity = source.Quantity
WHEN MATCHED AND source.Quantity = 0 THEN
    DELETE
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (ProductId, Quantity)
    VALUES (source.ProductId, source.Quantity);
```

---

## Pagination

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: OFFSET-FETCH (SQL Server 2012+)
DECLARE @PageNumber INT = 2;
DECLARE @PageSize INT = 20;

SELECT 
    Id,
    Name,
    Email
FROM Users
ORDER BY Id
OFFSET (@PageNumber - 1) * @PageSize ROWS
FETCH NEXT @PageSize ROWS ONLY;

-- ✅ GOOD: Keyset pagination (better for large datasets)
DECLARE @LastSeenId INT = 1000;
DECLARE @PageSize INT = 20;

SELECT TOP (@PageSize)
    Id,
    Name,
    Email
FROM Users
WHERE Id > @LastSeenId
ORDER BY Id;
```

---

## Temp Tables vs Table Variables

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Temp table (better for large datasets, can have indexes)
CREATE TABLE #TempOrders (
    OrderId INT,
    OrderDate DATETIME2,
    TotalAmount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE INDEX IX_TempOrders_OrderDate ON #TempOrders(OrderDate);

INSERT INTO #TempOrders
SELECT Id, OrderDate, TotalAmount
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, SYSDATETIME());

-- Use temp table
SELECT * FROM #TempOrders;

-- Cleanup (automatic when session ends)
DROP TABLE #TempOrders;

-- ✅ GOOD: Table variable (better for small datasets < 100 rows)
DECLARE @OrderSummary TABLE (
    UserId INT,
    OrderCount INT,
    TotalSpent DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO @OrderSummary
SELECT 
    UserId,
    COUNT(*),
    SUM(TotalAmount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY UserId;

SELECT * FROM @OrderSummary;
```

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Find expensive queries
SELECT TOP 10
    qs.total_elapsed_time / qs.execution_count AS avg_elapsed_time,
    qs.execution_count,
    SUBSTRING(qt.text, (qs.statement_start_offset/2)+1,
        ((CASE qs.statement_end_offset
            WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(qt.text)
            ELSE qs.statement_end_offset
        END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2)+1) AS query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) qt
ORDER BY avg_elapsed_time DESC;

-- Check for blocking queries
SELECT 
    session_id,
    blocking_session_id,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;

-- Database size and usage
EXEC sp_spaceused;

-- Index usage statistics
SELECT 
    OBJECT_NAME(s.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    s.user_seeks,
    s.user_scans,
    s.user_lookups,
    s.user_updates
FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats s
INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON s.object_id = i.object_id 
    AND s.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE database_id = DB_ID()
ORDER BY s.user_seeks + s.user_scans + s.user_lookups DESC;
```
