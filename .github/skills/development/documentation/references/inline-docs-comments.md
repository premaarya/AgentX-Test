# Inline Documentation & Comment Patterns

## Inline Documentation

### When to Document

```
✅ DOCUMENT:
  - Public APIs (functions, classes exposed to others)
  - Complex algorithms (why this approach)
  - Non-obvious behavior (edge cases, gotchas)
  - Business rules (why this validation)
  - Workarounds (link to issue/bug)

❌ DON'T DOCUMENT:
  - Obvious code (// increment counter)
  - Implementation details that might change
  - What the code does (code shows that)
```

### Documentation Template

```
Function Documentation Structure:

  Brief one-line description.

  Longer description if needed. Explain the purpose,
  not the implementation.

  Parameters:
    paramName: Description of parameter
    
  Returns:
    Description of return value
    
  Raises/Throws:
    ExceptionType: When this exception is thrown
    
  Example:
    code example showing usage
```

### Examples

```
Good Documentation:

  """
  Calculate shipping cost based on weight and destination.
  
  Uses zone-based pricing with a base rate plus per-kg charge.
  International shipments have additional customs handling fee.
  
  Args:
    weight_kg: Package weight in kilograms (must be positive)
    destination: ISO 3166-1 country code (e.g., "US", "GB")
    
  Returns:
    Shipping cost in USD
    
  Raises:
    ValueError: If weight is negative or zero
    InvalidDestinationError: If country code is not supported
    
  Example:
    >>> calculate_shipping(2.5, "US")
    15.99
  """
```

## Comments

### When to Use Comments

```
Use Comments For:

1. WHY, not WHAT
   # Using binary search because list is sorted and frequently queried
   index = binarySearch(sortedList, target)

2. Complex business logic
   # Discount applies only to first-time customers who
   # ordered within 30 days of account creation (PROMO-2024-Q1)
   if isEligibleForNewUserDiscount(user):

3. Warnings and gotchas
   # WARNING: This API has a rate limit of 100 req/min
   # See: https://api.example.com/docs/rate-limits
   
4. TODO with context
   # TODO(ticket-123): Refactor when payment v2 API is available
   
5. References
   # Algorithm from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example
```

### Comment Anti-Patterns

```
❌ Redundant Comments:
  i = i + 1  # Increment i by 1

❌ Outdated Comments:
  # Returns the user's email
  function getUserName():  # Actually returns name now

❌ Commented-Out Code:
  # old_method()
  # another_old_method()
  new_method()

❌ Noise Comments:
  ###################################
  # BEGIN USER PROCESSING SECTION   #
  ###################################
