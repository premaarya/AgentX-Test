# API & Architecture Documentation Patterns

## API Documentation

### OpenAPI/Swagger

```
API Documentation Should Include:

Endpoint Information:
  - HTTP method and path
  - Description of what it does
  - Authentication requirements

Request:
  - Path parameters
  - Query parameters
  - Request body schema
  - Example request

Response:
  - Status codes and meanings
  - Response body schema
  - Example responses

Errors:
  - Error codes
  - Error messages
  - How to handle
```

### API Documentation Example

```yaml
/users/{userId}:
  get:
    summary: Get user by ID
    description: |
      Retrieves detailed information about a specific user.
      Requires authentication. Users can only access their own data
      unless they have admin role.
    parameters:
      - name: userId
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          type: integer
        description: Unique user identifier
    responses:
      200:
        description: User found
        content:
          application/json:
            example:
              id: 123
              email: user@example.com
              name: John Doe
      404:
        description: User not found
      403:
        description: Access denied
```

## Architecture Documentation

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

```
ADR Template:

# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a database that supports complex queries, transactions,
and can handle our expected load of 10K requests/second.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL 16 as our primary database.

## Consequences
### Positive
- ACID compliance
- Rich query capabilities
- Strong community support

### Negative
- Requires more operational expertise than managed NoSQL
- Vertical scaling limitations

## Alternatives Considered
- MongoDB: Rejected due to transaction requirements
- MySQL: PostgreSQL has better JSON support
```

### When to Write ADRs

```
Write ADR For:
  - Technology choices (database, framework, cloud provider)
  - Architecture patterns (microservices vs monolith)
  - Security decisions (auth strategy, encryption)
  - Integration approaches (sync vs async)
  - Breaking changes to existing patterns
```
