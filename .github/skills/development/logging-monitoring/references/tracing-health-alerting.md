# Distributed Tracing, Health Checks & Alerting

## Distributed Tracing

### Concept

Track a request as it flows through multiple services.

```
Trace Structure:

Trace (entire request journey)
  └── Span: API Gateway (50ms)
        └── Span: Auth Service (10ms)
        └── Span: User Service (30ms)
              └── Span: Database Query (15ms)
              └── Span: Cache Lookup (2ms)
        └── Span: Notification Service (5ms)
```

### Trace Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Trace** | End-to-end request journey |
| **Span** | Single operation within trace |
| **Trace ID** | Unique ID for entire trace |
| **Span ID** | Unique ID for single span |
| **Parent Span ID** | Links child spans to parent |

### What to Trace

```
✅ Trace:
  - HTTP requests (incoming and outgoing)
  - Database queries
  - Cache operations
  - Message queue publish/consume
  - External API calls

Context to Include:
  - Service name
  - Operation name
  - Duration
  - Status (success/error)
  - Error message (if failed)
  - Custom attributes (user_id, order_id, etc.)
```

## Health Checks

### Types

```
Liveness Check (/health/live):
  "Is the application running?"
  - Returns 200 if process is alive
  - Used by orchestrators to restart crashed containers

Readiness Check (/health/ready):
  "Is the application ready to serve traffic?"
  - Checks database connectivity
  - Checks cache availability
  - Checks external service health
  - Used by load balancers to route traffic
```

### Health Check Response

```
Response Format:

{
  "status": "healthy",  // or "unhealthy", "degraded"
  "checks": {
    "database": { "status": "healthy", "latency_ms": 5 },
    "cache": { "status": "healthy", "latency_ms": 1 },
    "external_api": { "status": "degraded", "error": "slow response" }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Alerting

### Alert Categories

```
Critical (Page immediately):
  - Application down
  - Error rate > 10%
  - Database unreachable
  - Security breach detected

Warning (Notify during business hours):
  - Error rate > 1%
  - Latency p99 > 5s
  - Disk usage > 80%
  - Certificate expiring in 7 days

Info (Review in dashboard):
  - Deployment completed
  - Backup succeeded
  - Usage approaching quota
```

### Alert Best Practices

```
✅ DO:
  - Alert on symptoms, not causes
  - Include runbook links in alerts
  - Set appropriate thresholds (avoid alert fatigue)
  - Group related alerts
  - Include context in alert message

❌ DON'T:
  - Alert on every error
  - Use the same severity for all alerts
  - Alert without actionable next steps
  - Create alerts that are always ignored
```
