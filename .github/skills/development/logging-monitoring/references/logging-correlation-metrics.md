# Log Messages, Correlation IDs & Metrics

## Log Message Guidelines

### What to Log

```
✅ DO Log:
  - Request start/end with duration
  - Business events (user actions, state changes)
  - Errors with context (what failed, why, input data)
  - External service calls (API calls, DB queries)
  - Security events (login, logout, permission denied)
  - Performance metrics (slow queries, cache misses)

❌ DON'T Log:
  - Passwords, API keys, tokens
  - Credit card numbers, SSN
  - Personal health information
  - Raw request/response bodies with sensitive data
  - High-frequency events that create noise
```

### Message Format

```
Good Log Message Pattern:
  {action} {subject} {outcome} {context}

Examples:
  ✅ "Processing order 12345 for user 67890"
  ✅ "Payment failed for order 12345: insufficient funds"
  ✅ "Database query completed in 150ms: SELECT * FROM users"

  ❌ "Error occurred"
  ❌ "Something went wrong"
  ❌ "null"
```

## Correlation IDs

### Concept

Track requests across multiple services/layers using a unique ID.

```
Request Flow:
  
  Client Request
       ↓ (X-Correlation-ID: abc-123)
  API Gateway
       ↓ (CorrelationId: abc-123)
  User Service
       ↓ (CorrelationId: abc-123)
  Database
       ↓ (CorrelationId: abc-123)
  Payment Service
       ↓ (CorrelationId: abc-123)
  Response

All logs include CorrelationId: abc-123
→ Easy to trace entire request path
```

### Implementation Pattern

```
Middleware Pattern:

function correlationMiddleware(request, response, next):
  # Get from header or generate new
  correlationId = request.headers["X-Correlation-ID"] 
                  or generateUUID()
  
  # Add to request context
  request.context.correlationId = correlationId
  
  # Add to response header
  response.headers["X-Correlation-ID"] = correlationId
  
  # Add to log context (all logs include it automatically)
  logger.setContext({ correlationId: correlationId })
  
  next()
```

## Metrics

### Types of Metrics

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Counter** | Cumulative count | `http_requests_total`, `errors_total` |
| **Gauge** | Current value | `active_connections`, `queue_size` |
| **Histogram** | Distribution of values | `request_duration_seconds` |
| **Summary** | Similar to histogram with quantiles | `request_latency_p99` |

### Key Metrics to Track

```
Application Metrics:
  - Request rate (requests/second)
  - Error rate (errors/second, error %)
  - Latency (p50, p95, p99 response times)
  - Active users/connections

Infrastructure Metrics:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk I/O
  - Network throughput

Business Metrics:
  - Orders per hour
  - Revenue per day
  - User signups
  - Conversion rate
```

### RED Method (Request-Driven)

```
Rate    - Requests per second
Errors  - Failed requests per second
Duration - Time per request (latency)

Dashboard should show:
  - Rate: Are we getting traffic?
  - Errors: Is something broken?
  - Duration: Is it slow?
```

### USE Method (Resource-Driven)

```
Utilization - % of resource used
Saturation  - Queue depth, waiting work
Errors      - Error events

Apply to: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network
```
