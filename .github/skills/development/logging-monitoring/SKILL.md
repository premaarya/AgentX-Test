# Logging & Monitoring

> **Purpose**: Implement observability for production systems.  
> **Goal**: Structured logs, correlation across requests, actionable metrics.  
> **Note**: For implementation, see [C# Development](../csharp/SKILL.md) or [Python Development](../python/SKILL.md).

## When to Use This Skill

- Adding structured logging to applications
- Implementing request correlation IDs
- Configuring metrics collection
- Setting up distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Designing alerting rules and health checks

## Prerequisites

- Logging framework installed
- Monitoring platform access

## Decision Tree

```
Observability concern?
├─ What to log?
│   ├─ Request start/end → INFO with correlation ID
│   ├─ Expected errors → WARN (validation, not-found)
│   ├─ Unexpected errors → ERROR with stack trace
│   └─ Debug details → DEBUG (disabled in production)
├─ What NOT to log?
│   └─ PII, passwords, tokens, credit cards → NEVER
├─ Metrics needed?
│   ├─ RED metrics: Rate, Errors, Duration (for services)
│   └─ USE metrics: Utilization, Saturation, Errors (for resources)
├─ Distributed tracing?
│   └─ OpenTelemetry for cross-service correlation
└─ Alerting?
    ├─ SLO-based: alert on error budget burn rate
    └─ Avoid alert fatigue: page only for actionable issues
```

## Structured Logging

### Concept

Log structured data (key-value pairs) instead of plain text for better searchability and analysis.

```
❌ Unstructured (hard to parse):
  "User john@example.com logged in from 192.168.1.1 at 2024-01-15 10:30:00"

✅ Structured (machine-readable):
  {
    "event": "user_login",
    "user_email": "john@example.com",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "level": "INFO"
  }
```

### Benefits

- **Searchable**: Query by any field
- **Filterable**: Show only errors, specific users, etc.
- **Aggregatable**: Count events, calculate averages
- **Parseable**: Tools can process automatically

## Log Levels

### Standard Levels

| Level | When to Use | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **TRACE** | Very detailed debugging | "Entering function with params: {x: 1, y: 2}" |
| **DEBUG** | Debugging information | "Cache hit for key: user_123" |
| **INFO** | Normal operations | "User logged in", "Order created" |
| **WARN** | Unexpected but recoverable | "Retry attempt 2 of 3", "Rate limit approaching" |
| **ERROR** | Failures requiring attention | "Payment failed", "Database connection lost" |
| **FATAL** | Application cannot continue | "Out of memory", "Configuration invalid" |

### Level Configuration by Environment

```
Development: DEBUG or TRACE
  - See detailed information for debugging

Staging: INFO
  - Normal operations plus warnings/errors

Production: INFO (or WARN)
  - Reduce noise, focus on significant events
  - Keep ERROR/FATAL always enabled
```

## Best Practices Summary

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Structured logging** | JSON format with key-value pairs |
| **Correlation IDs** | Trace requests across services |
| **Appropriate levels** | DEBUG in dev, INFO+ in prod |
| **No sensitive data** | Never log passwords, tokens, PII |
| **Context in errors** | Include what, why, and how to fix |
| **Meaningful metrics** | Track rate, errors, duration |
| **Health checks** | Liveness + readiness endpoints |
| **Actionable alerts** | Include runbooks, reduce noise |

## Observability Tools

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Logging** | ELK Stack, Splunk, Datadog Logs, CloudWatch Logs |
| **Metrics** | Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch |
| **Tracing** | Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog APM, Application Insights |
| **All-in-One** | Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace, Elastic Observability |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Logs not appearing in monitoring platform | Check log level configuration, verify sink/exporter endpoint |
| Correlation IDs missing across services | Propagate W3C trace context headers in all HTTP calls |
| Alert fatigue from too many notifications | Set meaningful thresholds, group related alerts, add alert suppression windows |
