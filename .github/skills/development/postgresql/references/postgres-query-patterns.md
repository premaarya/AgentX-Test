# PostgreSQL Window Functions, CTEs & Performance

## Window Functions

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Window functions
-- Row number
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    category,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY created_at DESC) AS row_num
FROM products;

-- Ranking
SELECT 
    id,
    score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM scores;

-- Running totals
SELECT 
    date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM transactions;

-- Moving average
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    AVG(value) OVER (
        ORDER BY date 
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS moving_avg_7day
FROM metrics;

-- Lag and Lead
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    LAG(value, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS previous_value,
    LEAD(value, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS next_value,
    value - LAG(value, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS change
FROM metrics;
```

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Recursive CTE for hierarchical data
WITH RECURSIVE category_tree AS (
    -- Base case: root categories
    SELECT id, name, parent_id, 1 AS level, name AS path
    FROM categories
    WHERE parent_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: child categories
    SELECT 
        c.id, 
        c.name, 
        c.parent_id,
        ct.level + 1,
        ct.path || ' > ' || c.name
    FROM categories c
    INNER JOIN category_tree ct ON c.parent_id = ct.id
)
SELECT * FROM category_tree
ORDER BY path;

-- ✅ GOOD: Multiple CTEs
WITH active_users AS (
    SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE is_active = true
),
recent_orders AS (
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT 
    u.name,
    COALESCE(ro.order_count, 0) AS recent_orders
FROM active_users u
LEFT JOIN recent_orders ro ON u.id = ro.user_id
ORDER BY recent_orders DESC;
```

## Performance Optimization

### Index Strategies

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Index types
-- B-tree (default, good for equality and range queries)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created ON orders(created_at);

-- GIN (good for JSONB, arrays, full-text)
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_tags ON posts USING gin(tags);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_profile ON users USING gin(profile);

-- GiST (good for geometric and range types)
CREATE INDEX idx_locations_point ON locations USING gist(coordinates);

-- Partial index (smaller, faster)
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(email)
WHERE is_active = true;

-- Expression index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_lower_email ON users(LOWER(email));

-- Multi-column index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, created_at);
```

### Query Optimization

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE user_id = 123
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- ✅ GOOD: Efficient pagination
-- Use cursor-based pagination
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE id > 1000  -- Last seen ID
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 20;

-- Avoid OFFSET for large datasets
-- ❌ BAD: OFFSET is slow for large offsets
SELECT * FROM posts
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 10000;

-- ✅ GOOD: Batching with CTEs
WITH batch AS (
    SELECT id FROM large_table
    WHERE needs_processing = true
    LIMIT 1000
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
)
UPDATE large_table
SET needs_processing = false
FROM batch
WHERE large_table.id = batch.id;
```
