# Dependency Selection & Monorepo Patterns

## Dependency Selection

### Evaluation Criteria

```
Before Adding a Dependency:

✅ Check:
  - Maintenance status (recent commits, active maintainers)
  - Security history (past vulnerabilities, response time)
  - License compatibility (MIT, Apache OK; GPL may not be)
  - Download/usage statistics (popular = battle-tested)
  - API stability (frequent breaking changes?)
  - Bundle size (for frontend packages)
  - Transitive dependencies (brings in how many others?)

❌ Red Flags:
  - No updates in 2+ years
  - Many open security issues
  - Single maintainer, no bus factor
  - Excessive transitive dependencies
  - Unclear or restrictive license
```

### Minimize Dependencies

```
Questions Before Adding:
  1. Can I implement this myself in < 100 lines?
  2. Does the standard library provide this?
  3. Do I need the whole package or just one function?
  4. Is this a core feature or rarely used?

Alternatives:
  - Copy small utility functions (with attribution)
  - Use standard library alternatives
  - Write custom implementation for simple needs
```

## Monorepo Dependencies

### Shared Dependencies

```
Central Package Management:

  /project-root
    /packages.props  (or package.json workspace)
      - Define versions once
      - All projects use same versions
    
    /service-a
      - References packages (no version)
    
    /service-b
      - References packages (no version)

Benefits:
  - Consistent versions across all services
  - Single place to update
  - Easier security patching
```
