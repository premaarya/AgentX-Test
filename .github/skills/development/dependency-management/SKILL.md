# Dependency Management

> **Purpose**: Manage third-party dependencies securely and reliably.  
> **Goal**: Reproducible builds, no vulnerable packages, controlled updates.  
> **Note**: For implementation, see [C# Development](../csharp/SKILL.md) or [Python Development](../python/SKILL.md).

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Adding new packages or libraries
- Pinning dependency versions for reproducibility
- Scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Updating outdated dependencies safely
- Managing monorepo dependency graphs

## Prerequisites

- Package manager installed (npm, pip, NuGet, cargo, etc.)

## Decision Tree

```
Dependency concern?
├─ Adding new dependency?
│   ├─ Actively maintained? (commits in last 6 months) → Proceed
│   ├─ License compatible? (MIT/Apache → OK, GPL → careful)
│   ├─ Too many transitive deps? → Consider lighter alternative
│   └─ Can you build it in < 1 hour? → Maybe don't add dependency
├─ Updating dependencies?
│   ├─ Patch update (0.0.x) → Usually safe, auto-update
│   ├─ Minor update (0.x.0) → Review changelog, test
│   └─ Major update (x.0.0) → Review breaking changes, plan migration
├─ Vulnerability found?
│   ├─ Direct dependency? → Update immediately
│   └─ Transitive? → Override version or update parent
└─ Lock file conflict?
    └─ Delete lock file → reinstall → commit new lock file
```

## Core Concepts

### Dependency Types

```
Direct Dependencies:
  - Packages your code imports directly
  - Listed in your package manifest

Transitive Dependencies:
  - Dependencies of your dependencies
  - Automatically pulled in
  - Often source of vulnerabilities

Development Dependencies:
  - Testing frameworks
  - Build tools
  - Linters
  - NOT shipped to production
```

### Dependency Files

```
Manifest File (what you want):
  - Lists packages and version constraints
  - Human-editable
  - Committed to version control

Lock File (what you get):
  - Lists exact versions resolved
  - Includes transitive dependencies
  - Machine-generated
  - Committed to version control

Examples by Language:
  Language    | Manifest           | Lock File
  ------------|--------------------|-----------------
  .NET        | *.csproj           | packages.lock.json
  Python      | pyproject.toml     | poetry.lock
  Node.js     | package.json       | package-lock.json
  Go          | go.mod             | go.sum
  Rust        | Cargo.toml         | Cargo.lock
```

## Best Practices Summary

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Use lock files** | Commit and respect lock files |
| **Pin production deps** | Exact versions for reproducibility |
| **Scan regularly** | Automated vulnerability scanning |
| **Update strategically** | Patch often, minor carefully, major planned |
| **Minimize dependencies** | Every dep is a liability |
| **Review licenses** | Ensure compatibility |
| **Separate dev deps** | Don't ship test frameworks |
| **Audit new deps** | Evaluate before adding |

## Dependency Management Tools

| Language | Package Manager | Vulnerability Scanner |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **.NET** | NuGet, dotnet | `dotnet list package --vulnerable` |
| **Python** | pip, poetry | pip-audit, safety |
| **Node.js** | npm, yarn, pnpm | `npm audit`, Snyk |
| **Java** | Maven, Gradle | OWASP Dependency-Check |
| **Go** | go mod | govulncheck |
| **Rust** | Cargo | cargo-audit |

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| [`audit-deps.ps1`](scripts/audit-deps.ps1) | Audit for outdated/vulnerable dependencies (.NET/Python/Node) | `./scripts/audit-deps.ps1 [-FailOnVulnerability]` |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Conflicting dependency versions | Use package manager resolution strategy, check peer dependency requirements |
| Vulnerability found in transitive dep | Override/force specific version, or find alternative package |
| Lock file merge conflicts | Delete lock file, reinstall dependencies, commit fresh lock file |
