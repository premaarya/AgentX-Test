# Test Organization, CI/CD & Common Pitfalls

## Test Organization

### Test File Structure

```
Project Structure:
  src/
    services/
      UserService
      PaymentService
    repositories/
      UserRepository
  
  tests/
    unit/
      services/
        UserService.test
        PaymentService.test
      repositories/
        UserRepository.test
    integration/
      api/
        UserEndpoints.test
        PaymentEndpoints.test
    e2e/
      checkout/
        CheckoutFlow.test
```

### Test Naming

**Descriptive Test Names:**
```
✅ Good:
  - test_getUser_withValidId_returnsUser
  - test_processPayment_whenInsufficientFunds_throwsError
  - test_calculateDiscount_forNewUser_applies10PercentOff

❌ Bad:
  - test1
  - testGetUser
  - testPayment
```

## Continuous Testing

### Run Tests in CI/CD

**CI Pipeline:**
```yaml
steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Install dependencies
  3. Run linter
  4. Run unit tests
  5. Run integration tests
  6. Generate coverage report
  7. Fail if coverage < 80%
  8. Run E2E tests (optional, can be separate pipeline)
```

### Test Automation

- Run tests on every commit
- Block PRs if tests fail
- Run tests in parallel for speed
- Retry flaky tests automatically
- Generate test reports
- Track test metrics over time

## Common Testing Pitfalls

| Issue | Problem | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Flaky tests** | Tests pass/fail randomly | Fix timing issues, use retries, improve test isolation |
| **Slow tests** | Test suite takes too long | Parallelize, use in-memory DBs, mock external services |
| **Brittle tests** | Tests break with minor changes | Test behavior not implementation, use stable selectors |
| **Over-mocking** | Too many mocks, tests don't catch real bugs | Balance mocks with integration tests |
| **Under-testing** | Low coverage, bugs slip through | Follow test pyramid, aim for 80%+ coverage |
| **Untestable code** | Hard to write tests | Refactor for dependency injection, smaller functions |
