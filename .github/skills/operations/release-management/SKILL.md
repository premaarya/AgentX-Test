## When to Use This Skill

- Planning release pipelines and strategies
- Choosing deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Implementing automated release workflows
- Designing rollback procedures
- Setting up versioning with SemVer or CalVer

## Prerequisites

- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure
- Version control system (Git)

## Quick-Start: Deployment Strategy Selection

Pick your strategy **first** — everything else follows from this choice.

| Strategy | Best For | Downtime | Rollback Speed | Infra Cost | Complexity |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **Rolling** | Most apps, K8s-native | None | Medium (pod-by-pod) | Same | Low |
| **Blue-Green** | Zero-downtime critical | None | **Instant** (swap) | **2×** | Medium |
| **Canary** | Risk-sensitive releases | None | Medium (scale to 0) | +10-25% | High |
| **Feature Flags** | Gradual user rollout | None | **Instant** (toggle) | Same | Medium |
| **Recreate** | Dev/Test environments | **Yes** | Fast (redeploy) | Same | Low |

**Decision tree:**

```
Need zero-downtime?
├─ No  → Recreate (dev/test only)
└─ Yes
   ├─ Need instant rollback?
   │  ├─ Yes → Blue-Green  (if budget allows 2× infra)
   │  └─ Yes → Feature Flags (if code-level control preferred)
   └─ Need gradual risk reduction?
      ├─ Yes, by traffic %  → Canary
      └─ Default / simplest → Rolling
```

## Versioning Strategies

### Choosing a Versioning Scheme

```
Is your release cadence time-based (monthly/quarterly)?
├─ Yes → CalVer  (YYYY.MM.DD)
└─ No
   ├─ Do you expose a public API or library?
   │  └─ Yes → SemVer  (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   └─ Internal service / continuous delivery?
      └─ Commit-Based  (v1.0.{count}+{sha})
```

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]`

**Version Increment Rules:**

| Bump | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **MAJOR** | Incompatible / breaking API changes | `1.x.x → 2.0.0` |
| **MINOR** | New functionality, backward-compatible | `1.1.x → 1.2.0` |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes, backward-compatible | `1.1.1 → 1.1.2` |
| **PRERELEASE** | alpha → beta → rc progression | `2.0.0-rc.1` |
| **BUILD** | Metadata only (commit hash, CI number) | `2.0.0+build.47` |

**Key rules:**
- Once a version is released, its contents **must not** change
- Pre-release versions (`-alpha.1`, `-beta.2`, `-rc.1`) have lower precedence than the release
- Build metadata (`+build.1`) is ignored for version precedence

### Calendar Versioning (CalVer)

Format: `YYYY.MM[.DD][.MICRO]`

**When to use:**
- Time-based release cadences (monthly, quarterly)
- Marketing-driven version numbers
- Consumer products with regular update schedules
- Ubuntu, pip, and similar projects use CalVer

### Commit-Based Versioning

Format: `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{COMMIT_COUNT}+{SHORT_SHA}`

Best for internal services with continuous delivery where every merge to `main` is a release candidate.

### Pre-Release Label Progression

| Label | Meaning | Audience |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `alpha.N` | Early testing, unstable | Internal team |
| `beta.N` | Feature-complete, bugs expected | Early adopters |
| `rc.N` | Release candidate, production-ready | Wider testing |
| `snapshot` | Development build | CI only |

## Deployment Strategies — Concepts

### Blue-Green Deployment

Two identical production environments; deploy to inactive, test, swap traffic.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | DNS / load-balancer swap between Blue ↔ Green |
| **Rollback** | Instant — swap back to previous environment |
| **Tradeoff** | Requires 2× infrastructure; database migrations need care |

**Pros:** Zero downtime · Instant rollback · Full pre-switch testing
**Cons:** Double infrastructure cost · DB migration complexity

### Canary Deployment

Route a small percentage of traffic to the new version; expand on success.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | Weighted routing (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%) |
| **Rollback** | Scale canary to 0 replicas |
| **Tradeoff** | Needs monitoring infra; longer total deploy time |

**Pros:** Low risk · Real user feedback · Gradual rollout
**Cons:** Complex setup · Requires robust observability

### Rolling Deployment

Replace instances one-at-a-time (or in small batches).

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | Orchestrator replaces pods with `maxSurge` / `maxUnavailable` |
| **Rollback** | Automatic on failed health checks (K8s native) |
| **Tradeoff** | Mixed versions during rollout window |

**Pros:** Built-in to K8s / ECS · Zero downtime · Automatic rollback
**Cons:** Briefly mixed versions · Slower than blue-green

### Feature Flags / Feature Toggles

Deploy code with features disabled; enable via configuration per user/percentage.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Mechanism** | Runtime config toggle (LaunchDarkly, Azure App Config, custom) |
| **Rollback** | Instant — flip flag to `false` |
| **Tradeoff** | Flag debt accumulates; needs cleanup process |

**Pros:** Instant rollback · Decouple deploy from release · A/B testing
**Cons:** Code complexity · Stale flag cleanup required

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Decision Criteria

Trigger a rollback when **any** of these thresholds are breached post-deploy:

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Error rate | > 2× baseline | Automatic rollback |
| Health check | HTTP != 200 for > 2 min | Automatic rollback |
| P95 latency | > 50% degradation | Investigate → manual rollback |
| Critical bug | Functionality broken | Immediate manual rollback |
| Security vuln | Any CVE discovered | Immediate manual rollback |

### Rollback Strategies by Deployment Type

| Deployment Type | Rollback Method | Speed |
|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Blue-Green** | Swap traffic back to previous env | Instant |
| **Canary** | Scale canary replicas to 0 | < 1 min |
| **Rolling** | `kubectl rollout undo` | 2-5 min |
| **Feature Flags** | Disable flag | Instant |
| **Container** | Redeploy previous image tag | 2-5 min |

### Database Rollback Principles

1. **Forward-only migrations** — never drop columns; deprecate first
2. **Backward-compatible changes** — new code must work with old schema during rollout
3. **Blue-green with separate DBs** — rollback by switching connection string
4. **Always test undo scripts** in staging before production

## Release Pipeline Architecture

A release pipeline should follow this stage progression:

```
Validate Tag → Build → Test → Create Release → Deploy Staging
    → Smoke Tests → Deploy Production → Post-Deploy Verification
```

**Key pipeline principles:**
- Trigger on semantic version tags (`v*.*.*`)
- Build once, deploy the **same artifact** to every environment
- Gate production deployment behind staging smoke tests
- Use GitHub Environments with required reviewers for production
- Generate changelog automatically from conventional commits
- Attach build artifacts to GitHub Releases

## Release Automation

### What to Automate

| Task | Tool / Approach |
|------|-----------------|
| **Version bumping** | Conventional Commits → `npm version` / `dotnet-gitversion` |
| **Changelog generation** | `git log --grep` by type (feat/fix/chore) |
| **Tag + Release creation** | `softprops/action-gh-release` or `gh release create` |
| **Pre-release detection** | Tag contains `-alpha` / `-beta` → mark as pre-release |
| **Smoke tests** | Automated health check + critical-path tests post-deploy |
| **Rollback trigger** | Health check failure → auto-redeploy previous version |
| **Notifications** | Slack / Teams webhook on deploy success or failure |

### Conventional Commits → Version Bump Mapping

| Commit Prefix | Version Bump | Example Message |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `feat:` | MINOR | `feat: add dark mode support` |
| `fix:` | PATCH | `fix: resolve login timeout (#123)` |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` | MAJOR | `feat!: redesign auth API` |
| `chore:` / `docs:` | No bump | `docs: update README` |

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Use semantic versioning consistently; tag every release in VCS
- Maintain changelogs automatically via conventional commits
- Version APIs explicitly (URL path or header)
- Always test in staging before production
- Use gradual rollouts (canary / feature flags) for high-risk changes
- Monitor error rates and latency during and after deployment
- Have a **tested** rollback plan before every release
- Document procedures in a runbook
- Notify stakeholders before the deployment window
- Communicate breaking changes with migration guides
- Automate version bumping, changelog generation, and smoke tests
- Trigger automated rollback on health check failure
- Establish baseline metrics before each release
- Implement `/health` and `/ready` endpoints on every service

### ❌ DON'T

- Deploy on Fridays, holidays, or outside on-call hours
- Skip staging validation — even for "small" changes
- Deploy without a documented rollback plan
- Bundle multiple major changes into a single release
- Skip versions or hard-code version numbers
- Deploy without active monitoring and on-call coverage
- Ignore failed health checks
- Rush deployments under time pressure
