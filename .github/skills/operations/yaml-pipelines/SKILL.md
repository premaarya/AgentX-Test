## Decision Tree — Choosing a Platform

```
Is your code hosted on GitHub?
├─ YES → Use GitHub Actions (see ../github-actions-workflows/SKILL.md)
├─ NO
│   ├─ Using Azure DevOps for work items & repos?
│   │   └─ YES → Use Azure Pipelines
│   ├─ Using GitLab for repos & issue tracking?
│   │   └─ YES → Use GitLab CI/CD
│   └─ Need multi-platform or hybrid?
│       └─ Use Azure Pipelines (broadest agent/pool support)
```

**Key considerations**:
- **Azure Pipelines**: Best native integration with Azure services, variable groups, service connections, and approval gates.
- **GitLab CI**: Tightest integration when you already use GitLab for SCM + issues + registry.
- **GitHub Actions**: Ideal for open-source and GitHub-native workflows (covered in its own skill).

## Core Concepts

### Pipeline Anatomy

Every YAML pipeline shares these building blocks:

| Concept | Azure Pipelines | GitLab CI |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Trigger** | `trigger:` / `pr:` | `rules:` / `only:` / `except:` |
| **Stage** | `stages: [{stage: ...}]` | `stages: [build, test, deploy]` |
| **Job** | `jobs: [{job: ...}]` | Job name at root level |
| **Step** | `steps: [{script: ...}]` | `script:` array |
| **Template** | `template:` keyword | `include:` + `extends:` |
| **Variable** | `variables:` / `parameters:` | `variables:` |
| **Artifact** | `PublishPipelineArtifact` | `artifacts:` |
| **Cache** | `Cache@2` task | `cache:` keyword |
| **Environment** | `environment:` on deployment | `environment:` on job |

---

## Minimal Examples

### Azure Pipelines — Build + Deploy

```yaml
# azure-pipelines.yml
trigger: [main]

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  buildConfig: 'Release'

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - script: dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfig)
    - script: dotnet test --no-build
    - publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
      artifact: drop

- stage: Deploy
  dependsOn: Build
  condition: eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')
  jobs:
  - deployment: Production
    environment: production
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - download: current
            artifact: drop
          - script: echo "Deploying..."
```

### GitLab CI — Build + Deploy

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
image: node:20
stages: [build, test, deploy]

cache:
  paths: [node_modules/]

build:
  stage: build
  script: [npm ci, npm run build]
  artifacts:
    paths: [dist/]

test:
  stage: test
  script: [npm test]

deploy:production:
  stage: deploy
  script: [npm run deploy:production]
  environment: { name: production }
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"'
      when: manual
```

## Pipeline Design Patterns (Summary)

| Pattern | When to use | Key idea |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Sequential** | Simple build → test → deploy | Each stage `dependsOn` the prior |
| **Parallel jobs** | Independent test suites | Multiple jobs in one stage |
| **Fan-out / Fan-in** | Build once, test many, deploy once | Parallel stage converges to single deploy |
| **Canary** | Progressive production rollout | Deploy to canary → validate → full rollout |
| **Matrix** | Cross-platform / multi-version | `strategy.matrix` with OS or runtime combos |
| **Environment promotion** | Dev → QA → Staging → Prod | `dependsOn` chain with approval gates |

## Multi-Stage Pipelines (Summary)

Multi-stage pipelines split CI and CD into discrete, gated stages.

**Azure**: Use `stages:` with `deployment` jobs, `environment:` for gate approvals, and `condition:` for branch filtering.

**GitLab**: Use named stages with `environment:`, `when: manual` for approval gates, and `rules:` for branch filtering.

| Capability | Azure | GitLab |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Approval gates | Environment checks & approvals | `when: manual` |
| Branch filters | `condition:` expressions | `rules:` / `only:` |
| Artifact passing | `download: current` | `dependencies:` / `needs:` |
| Rollback | Re-run previous deployment | Re-trigger prior stage |

## Templates, Variables, Caching (Summary)

### Templates & Reusability

- **Azure**: `template:` keyword with `parameters:`. Supports step, job, and stage templates.
- **GitLab**: `include:` (local/remote/project) + `extends:` for inheritance.

### Variables & Parameters

- **Azure**: `variables:` (compile/runtime), `parameters:` (typed inputs), variable groups.
- **GitLab**: `variables:` (global/job), CI/CD UI variables, `dotenv` artifacts.

### Caching

- **Azure**: `Cache@2` task with composite key (`OS | lockfile`).
- **GitLab**: `cache:` with `key:`, `paths:`, `policy:` (pull/push/pull-push).

### Conditions

- **Azure**: `condition:` with expressions — `eq()`, `and()`, `startsWith()`.
- **GitLab**: `rules:` with `if:`, `changes:`, `exists:`, `when:`.

## Security & Secrets

### Principles

1. **Never hardcode secrets** — use platform secret stores
2. **Least privilege** — scope service connections and tokens narrowly
3. **Mask secrets** — both platforms auto-mask; verify with `echo` tests
4. **Rotate regularly** — automate rotation where possible
5. **Scan continuously** — integrate SAST, dependency scanning, secret detection

### Platform Secret Stores

| Platform | Store | Access pattern |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Azure Pipelines | Variable groups + Key Vault | `AzureKeyVault@2` task, `$(secret)` |
| GitLab CI | Settings → CI/CD → Variables | `$SECRET_NAME`, protected/masked flags |

### Security Scanning Checklist

- [ ] SAST (static analysis) in test stage
- [ ] Dependency scanning for known CVEs
- [ ] Secret detection in pre-commit and CI
- [ ] Container image scanning (if applicable)
- [ ] License compliance checks

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

**Pipeline Structure:**
- Use multi-stage pipelines for complex workflows
- Separate build, test, and deploy stages
- Implement proper stage dependencies
- Use templates for reusable logic

**Performance:**
- Cache dependencies aggressively (lockfile-keyed)
- Use matrix builds for parallel testing
- Minimize artifact size and retention
- Parallelize independent jobs

**Security:**
- Store secrets in platform-native secret stores
- Use protected variables for production
- Scan for vulnerabilities automatically
- Implement least-privilege service connections
- Never log or echo sensitive values

**Testing:**
- Run tests in CI — fail the build on failure
- Publish test results and coverage reports
- Fail fast on critical errors
- Test deployment process in lower environments first

**Deployment:**
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement approval gates for production
- Test rollback procedures
- Monitor deployment health post-release

### ❌ DON'T

**Anti-Patterns:**
- Hardcode secrets or credentials in YAML
- Skip testing stages for "quick" deploys
- Deploy to production from feature branches
- Ignore pipeline failures ("it'll fix itself")
- Build monolithic single-job pipelines

**Performance Anti-Patterns:**
- Run all jobs sequentially when they can be parallel
- Skip caching for dependencies restored every run
- Retain all artifacts indefinitely (set `expire_in`)
- Run unnecessary steps on every trigger

**Security Anti-Patterns:**
- Echo secrets in scripts or expose in artifacts
- Use org-wide service connections for single projects
- Skip security scanning to "save time"
- Share production credentials across environments

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Pipeline YAML validation error | Use the pipeline editor validation feature, check indentation and syntax |
| Secret not available in pipeline | Check variable group is linked, verify secret scope matches stage/job |
