# Orchestration Patterns

Guide to multi-agent orchestration patterns using Microsoft Agent Framework.

## Pattern Overview

| Pattern | Use Case | Complexity |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Sequential | Step-by-step processing | Low |
| Parallel | Independent tasks | Medium |
| Conditional | Decision-based routing | Medium |
| Group Chat | Collaborative discussion | High |
| Fan-out/Fan-in | Distribute and aggregate | High |
| Human-in-the-Loop | Approval workflows | Medium |

## Sequential Workflow

Agents execute in order, passing results to the next.

```python
from agent_framework.workflows import SequentialWorkflow

# Define agents
researcher = {
    "name": "Researcher",
    "instructions": "Research the topic and provide key findings."
}

writer = {
    "name": "Writer",
    "instructions": "Write a report based on the research findings."
}

editor = {
    "name": "Editor",
    "instructions": "Edit the report for clarity and grammar."
}

# Create workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    handoff_strategy="on_completion"
)

# Execute
result = await workflow.run(
    query="Write a report on AI trends in 2026"
)
```

## Parallel Workflow

Multiple agents work simultaneously on different tasks.

```python
from agent_framework.workflows import ParallelWorkflow

# Define parallel agents
market_analyst = {
    "name": "Market Analyst",
    "instructions": "Analyze market trends and opportunities."
}

tech_analyst = {
    "name": "Tech Analyst", 
    "instructions": "Analyze technical landscape and innovations."
}

risk_analyst = {
    "name": "Risk Analyst",
    "instructions": "Identify and assess potential risks."
}

# Create parallel workflow
workflow = ParallelWorkflow(
    agents=[market_analyst, tech_analyst, risk_analyst],
    aggregator={
        "name": "Aggregator",
        "instructions": "Combine all analyses into a comprehensive report."
    }
)

# Execute (all agents run in parallel, then aggregator combines)
result = await workflow.run(
    query="Comprehensive analysis of AI startup landscape"
)
```

## Conditional Workflow

Route to different agents based on conditions.

```python
from agent_framework.workflows import ConditionalWorkflow

# Define specialized agents
support_agent = {
    "name": "Support Agent",
    "instructions": "Handle customer support inquiries."
}

sales_agent = {
    "name": "Sales Agent",
    "instructions": "Handle sales and pricing questions."
}

technical_agent = {
    "name": "Technical Agent",
    "instructions": "Handle technical questions and troubleshooting."
}

# Define routing logic
def route_query(query: str) -> str:
    query_lower = query.lower()
    if any(word in query_lower for word in ["price", "buy", "purchase", "cost"]):
        return "sales"
    elif any(word in query_lower for word in ["error", "bug", "fix", "issue"]):
        return "technical"
    else:
        return "support"

# Create conditional workflow
workflow = ConditionalWorkflow(
    router=route_query,
    agents={
        "support": support_agent,
        "sales": sales_agent,
        "technical": technical_agent
    }
)

# Execute
result = await workflow.run(
    query="I'm getting an error when I try to login"
)  # Routes to technical_agent
```

## Group Chat

Multiple agents collaborate through conversation.

```python
from agent_framework.workflows import GroupChat

# Define participants
ceo = {
    "name": "CEO",
    "instructions": "Provide strategic direction and final decisions."
}

cto = {
    "name": "CTO",
    "instructions": "Advise on technical feasibility and architecture."
}

cfo = {
    "name": "CFO",
    "instructions": "Advise on budget and financial implications."
}

moderator = {
    "name": "Moderator",
    "instructions": "Keep discussion focused and summarize decisions."
}

# Create group chat
chat = GroupChat(
    participants=[ceo, cto, cfo],
    moderator=moderator,
    max_rounds=5,
    termination_condition="consensus_reached"
)

# Execute
result = await chat.run(
    topic="Should we invest in building an AI-powered product?"
)
```

## Fan-out/Fan-in

Distribute work across multiple agents, then aggregate.

```python
from agent_framework.workflows import FanOutFanIn

# Define worker agents (can be dynamically created)
def create_analyzer(section: str):
    return {
        "name": f"Section_{section}_Analyzer",
        "instructions": f"Analyze the {section} section thoroughly."
    }

sections = ["introduction", "methodology", "results", "conclusion"]
analyzers = [create_analyzer(s) for s in sections]

# Aggregator combines all results
aggregator = {
    "name": "Report Aggregator",
    "instructions": "Synthesize all section analyses into a cohesive review."
}

# Create fan-out/fan-in workflow
workflow = FanOutFanIn(
    workers=analyzers,
    aggregator=aggregator,
    distribute_strategy="round_robin"  # or "random", "load_balanced"
)

# Execute
result = await workflow.run(
    document="<full paper content>",
    task="Review this research paper"
)
```

## Human-in-the-Loop

Include human approval or input in the workflow.

```python
from agent_framework.workflows import HumanInTheLoop

# Define agent
code_generator = {
    "name": "Code Generator",
    "instructions": "Generate code based on requirements."
}

# Human approval callback
async def require_approval(output: str, context: dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    # In production, this would send to a human reviewer
    # For now, auto-approve if code looks valid
    if "def " in output or "class " in output:
        return True, "Code looks valid"
    else:
        return False, "Please regenerate with proper Python syntax"

# Create workflow with human gate
workflow = HumanInTheLoop(
    agent=code_generator,
    approval_gate=require_approval,
    max_retries=3
)

# Execute
result = await workflow.run(
    requirements="Create a function to validate email addresses"
)
```

## Loop with Reflection

Agent iterates on its own output using reflection.

```python
from agent_framework.workflows import ReflectiveLoop

# Define worker and critic
writer = {
    "name": "Writer",
    "instructions": "Write content based on the brief."
}

critic = {
    "name": "Critic",
    "instructions": "Review the content and provide specific improvement suggestions."
}

# Create reflective loop
workflow = ReflectiveLoop(
    worker=writer,
    critic=critic,
    max_iterations=3,
    stop_condition=lambda feedback: "excellent" in feedback.lower()
)

# Execute
result = await workflow.run(
    brief="Write a compelling product description for an AI assistant"
)
```

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Pattern

| Scenario | Recommended Pattern |
|----------|-------------------|
| Processing pipeline | Sequential |
| Independent analysis | Parallel |
| Customer service routing | Conditional |
| Brainstorming/Planning | Group Chat |
| Large document analysis | Fan-out/Fan-in |
| High-risk decisions | Human-in-the-Loop |
| Quality improvement | Loop with Reflection |

### Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel when possible** - Independent tasks should run concurrently
2. **Minimize handoffs** - Each handoff adds latency
3. **Set iteration limits** - Prevent infinite loops
4. **Use appropriate models** - Simpler agents can use faster/cheaper models
5. **Cache intermediate results** - Avoid redundant processing

### Error Handling

```python
from agent_framework.workflows import SequentialWorkflow, WorkflowError

try:
    result = await workflow.run(query="...")
except WorkflowError as e:
    print(f"Workflow failed at step {e.failed_step}: {e.message}")
    # Access partial results
    partial = e.partial_results
    # Retry from failed step
    result = await workflow.resume(from_step=e.failed_step)
```

### Monitoring

Enable tracing to visualize workflow execution:

```python
from agent_framework.observability import configure_otel_providers

configure_otel_providers(
    vs_code_extension_port=4317,
    enable_sensitive_data=True
)

# Now run your workflow - traces will show agent interactions
```

Open trace viewer: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `AI Toolkit: Open Trace Viewer`
