# Cognitive Architecture

> **Purpose**: Patterns for the cognitive components of AI agents: Memory, Knowledge (RAG), and Reasoning.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing **Memory Systems** (Conversation history, User profiles, Entity tracking).
- Building **RAG Pipelines** (Chunking, Embedding, Retrieval, Reranking).
- Managing **Agent State** across sessions.
- Selecting **Vector Databases** for knowledge retrieval.

## Decision Tree

```
Designing agent cognition?
+-- Need conversation history? -> Short-term memory (context window)
+-- Need factual knowledge? -> RAG pipeline (vector store + retrieval)
+-- Need user preferences across sessions? -> Long-term memory (database-backed)
+-- Need entity tracking? -> Episodic memory (structured state store)
+-- Need all of the above? -> Full cognitive architecture (all three layers)
+-- Unsure where to start? -> Start with RAG, add memory as needed
```

## Cognitive Components

A complete agent "brain" consists of three layers:

1. **Context (Short-term Memory)**: The active context window (conversation history).
2. **Knowledge (Long-term Memory/RAG)**: Static facts retrieved from vector stores or databases.
3. **State (Episodic Memory)**: Structured data about the user or task progress persisted indefinitely.

---

## Core Rules

1. **Layer separation** - Keep context, knowledge, and state as independent modules with clear interfaces
2. **Context window budget** - Allocate token budgets per cognitive layer and never exceed the model context limit
3. **Retrieval before generation** - Always retrieve relevant knowledge before generating a response
4. **Grounded responses** - Instruct the model to use only retrieved context and refuse when context is insufficient
5. **Memory lifecycle** - Define TTL and eviction policies for each memory layer (short-term expires, long-term persists)
6. **Metadata on every chunk** - Store source, timestamp, and relevance score with all knowledge chunks
7. **Test each layer independently** - Evaluate retrieval quality, memory recall, and state consistency separately

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scaffold-cognitive.py` | Scaffold RAG pipeline and/or Memory system modules | `python scaffold-cognitive.py --name my-agent --component all` |

**Options**:
- `--component rag` - RAG only (ingestion + retrieval + tests)
- `--component memory` - Memory only (short-term + long-term + tests)
- `--component all` - Both (default)
- `--vector-store azure-ai-search` - Use Azure AI Search instead of ChromaDB

---

## Reference Patterns

| Pattern | Description | File |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **RAG Pipeline** | Standard for ingesting and retrieving knowledge. | [pattern-rag-pipeline.md](references/pattern-rag-pipeline.md) |
| **Memory System** | Schema for short-term and long-term memory. | [pattern-memory-systems.md](references/pattern-memory-systems.md) |

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Unbounded context**: Stuffing entire conversation history into the context window -> Use progressive summarization or sliding window
- **No retrieval grounding**: Relying on the model's parametric knowledge for facts -> Always retrieve from a knowledge store
- **Monolithic memory**: Single flat store for all memory types -> Separate short-term, long-term, and episodic memory
- **Ignoring stale data**: Never refreshing knowledge indexes or memory entries -> Define TTL and refresh schedules per layer
- **Missing metadata**: Storing chunks without source, timestamp, or relevance info -> Attach metadata at ingestion time
- **Over-retrieving**: Fetching too many chunks and flooding the context window -> Use reranking and limit to top-K relevant results

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Hallucinations | Increase retrieval "groundedness" threshold or reduce `top_k`. |
| Context Window Overflow | Implement "Summarization" strategy for conversation history. |
| Slow Retrieval | Use "Hybrid Search" (Keyword + Semantic) with filtered metadata. |
