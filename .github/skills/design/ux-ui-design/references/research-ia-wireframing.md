# User Research, Information Architecture & Wireframing

## User Research & Analysis

### User Personas

Define **primary** and **secondary** personas covering: demographics, goals, pain points, behaviors, and a representative quote. Keep personas to one page each.

### User Journey Mapping

Map the end-to-end experience across these stages:

| Stage | Focus | Capture |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Awareness | How they find you | Channel, emotion |
| Consideration | Evaluating value | Features reviewed, hesitations |
| Sign Up | Registration | Friction points, drop-off |
| Onboarding | First use | Time to value, confusion |
| First Value | Goal achieved | Success signal, delight |

**Key output**: A list of **recommendations** with specific, actionable changes (e.g., "Reduce required fields to 3").

## Information Architecture

### Site Map

Organize content into a clear hierarchy. Every page needs: priority (P0–P3), content type, and status.

**Rules:**
- Max 7 ± 2 top-level items (Miller's Law)
- 3 clicks max to any content
- Group by user mental model, not org structure
- Authenticated vs. public areas clearly separated

### Content Inventory

| Page | Priority | Content Type | Status |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Home | P0 | Marketing | ✅ Done |
| Dashboard | P0 | Application | 🚧 In Progress |
| Settings | P1 | Application | ⏳ Pending |
| Docs | P1 | Content | ✅ Done |

## Wireframing

### Fidelity Levels

| Level | Purpose | Tools | When |
|-------|---------|-------|------|
| **Lo-fi** | Explore layout/structure | Pen & paper, Excalidraw | Early ideation |
| **Mid-fi** | Real labels, content structure | Balsamiq, Whimsical | After IA is set |
| **Hi-fi** | Pixel-perfect design | Figma, Sketch | Before dev handoff |

### Wireframe Checklist

- [ ] Content areas proportionally sized
- [ ] Navigation labels are real (not placeholder)
- [ ] Form fields have labels and hint text
- [ ] Button text describes the action (not "Click here")
- [ ] Annotations explain interactions
- [ ] Edge cases noted (empty state, overflow)
