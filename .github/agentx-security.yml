# AgentX Security Configuration
# 4-Layer Security Architecture for Autonomous Agent Operations

## Layer 1: Kill Switch
enabled: true  # Set to false to instantly disable all autonomous operations

## Layer 2: Protected Paths
# Files matching these patterns require manual review (no auto-merge)
protected_paths:
  - ".github/workflows/**"
  - ".github/agents/**"
  - ".vscode/**"
  - "AGENTS.md"
  - "Skills.md"
  - "package.json"
  - "package-lock.json"
  - "*.csproj"
  - "*.sln"
  - "pyproject.toml"
  - "poetry.lock"

## Layer 3: Actor Allowlist
# Only these actors can trigger auto-merge (managed in CODEOWNERS)
allowed_actors:
  - "github-actions[bot]"
  - "@jnPiyush"  # Repository owner

## Layer 4: Audit Trail
# All autonomous operations are logged in:
# - PR comments (security check results)
# - GitHub Actions logs (full execution trace)
# - Issue comments (agent handoff documentation)

## Agent Constraints
max_iterations: 15
max_tokens_per_iteration: 4000
slow_mode: false

## Command Safety
# Safe commands (auto-approved):
# - git commit, push, pull, fetch, status, diff, log
# - npm/yarn test, lint, build
# - dotnet/pytest test, build, run
# - gh issue, pr, repo, workflow commands

# Blocked commands (never auto-approve):
# - rm, rm -rf
# - kill, pkill
# - git reset --hard
# - drop database
# - any destructive operations

## Branch Protection
# Configure on GitHub:
# Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
# - Require pull request reviews
# - Require status checks to pass
# - Require conversation resolution
# - Do not allow bypassing the above settings
