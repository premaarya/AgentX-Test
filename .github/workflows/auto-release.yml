# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# AgentX Release Automation
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Automates semantic version bumping, CHANGELOG generation, and
# GitHub Release creation based on conventional commit messages.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Commits land on master with conventional prefixes (feat:, fix:, etc.)
#   2. release-please opens/updates a Release PR with version bump + CHANGELOG
#   3. Merging the Release PR creates a GitHub Release + git tag
#   4. Post-release step packages the VS Code extension VSIX
#
# Commit types -> version impact:
#   feat:     -> minor bump (5.3.0 -> 5.4.0)
#   fix:      -> patch bump (5.3.0 -> 5.3.1)
#   feat!:    -> major bump (5.3.0 -> 6.0.0)
#   docs:     -> patch bump
#   refactor: -> patch bump
#   perf:     -> patch bump
#   chore:    -> no release
